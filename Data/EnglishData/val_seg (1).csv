"im going to do something realy big tonight ive got high hopes that you and i wait, what are you going to do tonight im gonna tell my mum that i'm gay :/ i really hope she accepts me cos i can't take this any longer if shes a good mom, she will tell my mum that i'm gay i hope so this is really difficult for me she hasnt displayed any homophobia before has she you seem open minded a little like she jokes about gays and stuff like in a demeaning manner or just playfully with no ill will i can never tell my dad though. he HATES gay people. he even thinks they can be ""cured"" demeaning manner i think but i need to get this out i cant live like this much longer are you close with any aunts/uncles? who might be more receptive and help you ease into the topic with your mother? no they live far away i could tell my friend though it's just everytime i say to her (my frend) i need to talk well i mean on the phone i dont think physical proximity really matters on issues like this shes always busy or says another time :| ahh i could do it would help, because i have two gay cousins and what kind of tone does your mother use when talking about them she's okay acutally she does like my cousin deep down we're not really close to my other cousin much so we dont really talk about them thanks for listening to me it really helps oh well id say call both of them and ask for their opinions/thoughts/experiences when addressing the issue to their parents/relatives that sounds like a good idea okay that's great advice. Thanks so much for this no problem you're the only person so far that know im gay knkows* knows* anyway im going to be getting off now thanks again for this. it really helps btw, im 27 well good luck :| been in the closet that long i hope after telling someone you know, youll feel better and less stressed thanx man take care stay strong",0

"I fricking hate the web sometimes too many cats and bacon? if I have a set of floated elements inside a floated container and I have imported the css via <link> on a page server from the filsystem it breaks 1 out of 5 refreshes *served at least thats what I have so far, second I paste the css into the page it works 0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17: Never enough cats and bacon too much on the latter Can't say no to http://i.imgur.com/eqTIb.jpg heh, oh wow, I've left so many js projects unfinished, I should probably finish them. :O I've been afk from some stuff for too long no gameboy dev going on? Like how there's 2000 lines of 6502 opcode decoding and yet the video code isn't connected to the opcode decoding. gameboy color is done GBA was being brought up again 6502 for NES though. :P heh, I left myself comments on filling in remaining undocumented opcode handling though. :/ Since I manually inline everything, so it's spaghetti code for performance in firefox. :( 0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17: Saw the ARM7TDMI emulation core file I left myself, totally in the process of redoing it, since the opcode decoding was too complex for fast decoding without dispatch tables via arrays. :( Similar to the GBC emulator, but the opcode funcs array is dynamically built now doh Reading up on stuff like http://members.chello.nl/taf.offenga/illopc31.txt to finish out the undocumented opcode handling verification for the NES CPU emulation I know JSNES + most NES emulators don't do undocumented opcode handling because the info is limited a few of the undocumented opcodes are unreliable, as they differed between factory production runs like C64 vs Ricoh's custom most are stable, i.e. predictable and some simply are illegal - a.k.a. ""This kills the CPU"" due to the way the PLA lines are done in the 6502 (6502 is NOT microcoded) Heh, here's some of the NES code: http://pastebin.com/puHAP8db it's kinda all over the place in other files but the opcode stuff is there ok this looks like a chrome bug and I have no idea wtf is going on ? http://pastie.org/2958234 the css and the html need to be in seperate files when I load that div class=""item"" id=""shadow""> breaks its float every few refreshes omfg its something to do with using section :( sharing in here too the new html5shim is 1246 bytes gzipped, and 724 bytes gzipped for the printless version @ https://github.com/jonathantneal/html5shim heh while possibly not widely applicable, http://pomax.nihongoresources.com/downloads/temp/svgreversal was still fun to write.

"re: ""authors will at least prohibit links directly into those images"" I want to say that raising such barriers is against the nature of the web, but I'll just say it here and not mail it :) Henri, I know the arguments against <h> <l> and <separator> :), think they make sense too, it was just a p.s. of my personal opinion. Imho it's relatively easy to change and still have it work, and the naming would be better, but I don $Bc`QU (B expect it to get in HTML5. Although I would like them as secondary options, but I don $Bc`QU (B think that $Bc`QT (B going to happen. what are the benefits of introducing such new elements? to me, it seems like little more than a theoretical benefit based upon the name, rather than their actual definition in other words, if we a have a <foo> element, what's the benefit of introducing a <bar> element with exactly the same semantics, and less compatibility? the benefit of h is that you don't have to match against h1|h2|h3|h4|h5|h6 anymore, plus that it doesn $Bc`QU (B have a rank-indicator in it which doesn $Bc`QU (B apply, the benefit of <l> would be that it contains the line instead of delimiting it so that you can e.g. make line numbers (useful for source code), and the benefit of <separator> would be that the name more clearly reflects its function, and regardless of writing direction for <separator> that would be true, yes for h also, to some extent <l> introduces something new you can also more easily put IDs on <l> elements, to link to lines directly <pre><span>line</span> <span>line</span></pre> should handle line numbers it's also possible to get line numbers using <br> I would personally use <h>, it $Bc`QM (Bl be CSS-ed anyway so who cares if by default it doesn $Bc`QU (B render like a <h> on current browsers I think not having to match h1|h2 etc is a dead end. Most people (anecdotal) use hx where x gives the right default styling <l> is nicer than having those spans or trying to put line numbers on br In the HTML5 model, you don't even have to match against all of h1 to h76. You're allowed to use <h1> for all headings if you wish, when combined with <section> does an id on a br apply to the line before it or after it? etc yes, but it is not required never mind that last sentence, <h> would not be required either I don't see how <l> is much better. It's just a little bit shorter it indicates it $Bc`QT (B a line span indicates nothing plus line has supposedly got display:block attached to it <pre> already indicates that white space is preserved and lines are indicated using LF Doesn't that make <l> simply a tiny <p>? <pre> is bothersome because it messes up your indenting :) I think a much better way to handle the line number issue would be with a ::line pseudo-element in CSS besides not all cases where line breaking is important are also preformatted a ::line pseudo-element would mess up if you make the browser window too narrow and things would wrap not with white-space: pre; what if you want it to wrap perhaps with 'pre-wrap' or other value there's always <span> <span> can be the solution to any inline element in HTML :) a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9, the use case of <l> is pretty much the same as the use case for <br>. If you think <br> is a tiny <p>, then yes, <l> is a tiny <p> as well. <l> is not a block-level element (I think), it just uses display: block to force a line break Ah, ok since the use cases for <br> and <l> are identical, then <br> already covers most of them. Are there any more besides the line numbering that <br> can't handle well? so you would use it inside a <p>, eg. <p><l>ld b,255</l><l>djnz $</l></p> <br> doesn't work with CSS :after content: except on Opera I would have to think of it, I just mentioned it in passing really :) In that example it looks like subparagraphs, though :) but generally spoken container elements are better than separator elements a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9, <p> is maybe a bad choice :) This then: <blockcode><l>ld b,255</l><l>djnz $</l></blockcode> ;) (with a smiley face) a variant of the line numbers would be also stylistic; alternating colours When you say line numbers, I think <ol>. Without line numbers, <ul> or <pre> or white-space:pre on e.g. <blockcode>. 083d9a270e6e16b2fbb08d35067aae5f, that's just a browser limitation, there's nothing in CSS or HTML that prevents it from working or styling a specific line number (through ::nth-of-type) a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 I don $Bc`QU (B think that a list is the same as lines... so what about handling backwards compatibility without relying on stylesheets? Would authors be allowed to use a combination of <l> and <br>? You even number them, that makes it a list if you ask me a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9, simply proving line numbers doesn't make it a list a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9, I think you could hardly call lines of code in a block of code a list (although they do call it a listing ;p) f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220, I agree and it shows why we need test suites to combat such interop warts. <li> should work out of the box though, s/<li most good editors provide line numbers and it's useful if code samples are presented with them too s/<li>/<l>/ I suppose you could deprecate <br>, and discourage people to mix <l> and <br> 083d9a270e6e16b2fbb08d35067aae5f, I know we need test suites for helping achieve interop, I never said we didn't in the end it is a question of browser support, if all browsers implement <l> then we can be happy and use it, if they don't then we can either add 1 line to our CSS and mutter about the unsupporting browser, or choose <br> over <l> after all in HTML6 given that it doesn't seem difficult to implement, I think it would be nice to have it I'll admit that <l> is a small possibility, but I'm not totally convinced it would help if there were more use cases :) I am, however, totally unconvinced of <h> and <separator> I can imagine that For <h>, we could get the basic document hierarchy by counting all <hx> as headings, ignoring the x. And people could get the default styling they wanted without having to compromise the structure. that is what Web Applications 1.0 says currently, yes So what is the proposed benefit of <h> then? HTML5 almost does that. The numbers are still taken into account in some cases I already mentioned this earlier, dashiva as for <h> and <separator>, I'll see if I can make a well-prepared case for them later on, or just let it rest they are?? only without <section>, I hope? a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9, there are no use cases for <h> and <separator> that aren't already covered in HTML5 98e5b851bd2fd05b0d06825182bc9a9a: This? < 98e5b851bd2fd05b0d06825182bc9a9a> the benefit of h is that you don't have to match against h1|h2|h3|h4|h5|h6 anymore, plus that it doesn$Bc`QU(B have a rank-indicator in it which doesn$Bc`QU(B apply yes But matching against hx is a -benefit-, it gives people useful default styling a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9, you can have that with <h> too, easily a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9, theoretically, so would <h> based upon the nesting of sections. But sometimes you want a small heading without going through the intermediates well then your document isn't structured well :) Sure it is small heading implies styling :) The pure presentation of a single heading does not impact on the structure anyway, I don't think anybody disagrees on the usefulness of <section> Doesn't look like it",0

"roc, 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: If I recall correctly, CWT is similarly a super-thin wrapper over TTF. Isn't it nothing more than a header of a couple of bytes? It doesn't even employ any manipulation of the font-data (EOT can do compression on fonts, but the CWT proposal currently specifies uncompressed fonts, to avoid patent issues). doesn't EOT have XOR ""encryption""? I don't believe that the EOT version used for CWT does. (It's been a few months since the font discussion, though.) is pulling up the archives real quick to see if he can answer definitively. 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: I just confirmed - CWT uses *no* scrambling, XOR, MTX, or otherwise. does it alter the font file less than WOFF? *All* that it does is prepend the font with some header bytes. That's literally it. Chop off the header and you've got a perfectly valid ttf font. So, yes. (Since WOFF does the per-table compression.) I guess that is an advantage - the downside being that people who only test in IE may accidentally serve EOT fonts using more than the CWT subset True, but the common options used when generating EOT will make it immediately fail in a normal CWT-supporting browser. So you'd really have to test *only* in IE. Here's Daggett's 1.1 proposal. I think it's the latest 'official' specced version: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-font/2009JulSep/0969.html ""the common options used when generating EOT will make it immediately fail in a normal CWT-supporting browser"" -- that's not a feature! Sure it is. It keeps you from accidentally serving EOT. ^_^ it would be much better if the common options used when generating EOT made it Just Work(tm) in a normal CWT-supporting browser though I'm sure the tradeoff there is implementation complexity But the common option is one of the compression options. Yeah.",0

"fantasai: the SVG WG resolved to pubish FPWD of CSS3 Transforms, now waiting on CSS WG ratification http://www.w3.org/2012/02/16-svg-minutes.html#item01 and will be setting the stage (e.g. preparing documents, getting PLH's permission, etc.) 227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 - how about a LCWD of CSS3 Transforms? :) 3fe295a4e354ea5fb9ed0e38e876742b: we'll be discussing that shortly... thanks 0727cf52ad9f560d45e18372943ed695, appreciated 3fe295a4e354ea5fb9ed0e38e876742b: sounds greatâÃÂ¶ we need to resolve the issues first, but we should make this a priority 227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 - I think we should be able to go to LCWD with open issues (that is, we shouldn't have to bounce off zero issues) and I'm requesting to the AB that the Process be changed accordingly. 3fe295a4e354ea5fb9ed0e38e876742b: that's not ""Last Call"" that's ""Call"" 227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 - right, ""Last Call"" has been in practice a misnomer for a long time. hence LC just an abbreviation 3fe295a4e354ea5fb9ed0e38e876742b: for niceties, examples, clarifications, I agreeâÃÂ¶ but for fundamentally unsolved problems, I don't think I agree 227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 - for example, if we have rough agreement on syntax and feature set, I think it is appropriate to go to LC and there are still a few fundamental disagreements (with some features being labeled ""at risk"") (per lack of implementation) 3fe295a4e354ea5fb9ed0e38e876742b: let's not conflate the symbols of progress for concrete progress 227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 as long as such ""symbols"" block dropping of vendor prefixes, they are obstacles to concrete progress. that's an arcane CSS WG rule no it's connected to the CR definition of being the point where a call for implementations occurs. 3fe295a4e354ea5fb9ed0e38e876742b: I agree that the ""Call for Implementations"" is totally unreal and artificialâÃÂ¶ we need to create tests early on, because implementation happens at all stages, not just CR 227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 - I believe I can agree with all your assertions in that statement :) breakthrough! when 3fe295a4e354ea5fb9ed0e38e876742b and 227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 can agree on something, it's almost certainly rightâÃÂ¶ or totally wrong :)",0
"could someone educate me; what is the use case for iframe's srcdoc ? sandboxing comments in a blog post 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: how is srcdoc different from src=""data:text/html,... ? http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2010-January/024823.html 6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf: easier to not screw up the escaping 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: but that is the only difference? 6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf: the only one of consequence, i think ok there's also some minor things like you don't need a <title> in a srcdoc document and i may have said that it's always in standards mode, i forget I think I didn't find the place which describes the structure of srcdoc document I thought it would be parsed like data:text/html, well, like anything else can't remember if parser creates <title> automatically No oh another difference is that relative URLs in srcdoc documents resolve relative to the parent doc with data: URLs you can't use relative URLs similarly, Referer: headers get set correctly for srcdoc docs but not data: docs anyway the net result is that a srcdoc works better than data: would and you don't have to be as verbose and you're less likely to screw up the escaping, which makes it more secure in practice",0
"a well-defined error recovery that implies that any sequence of characters is accepted essentially closes all future extension points. you may think it's the right thing to do in HTML5, but rest assured that many people think different thus, in cases like date/tiem formats, it'll be up to HTML5 to define that error handling, and also to be prepared to live with the consequences of that approach no, it doesn't close all extension points at all if you accept *any* sequence of characters, oit does in fact, it improves the chance of adding extensions since there wouldn't be such wildly disparate implementations CSS had relatively well defined error handling and could process any sequence of bytes, but that hasn't stopped them defining extensions interoperability problems are what causes all the problems with defining extensions, since you not only have to remain relatively compatible what the original spec said, but with what each implementation does It's the difference between ""must understand"" to ""must ignore"" if you accept every input and parse it into a date, you do ""must ignore"" with respect to future extensions that may be the right thing in many cases, but *not* always so, whether something is specified as must understand or must ignore is irrelevent to whether or not its well defined I didn't say all input must be parsed into a date. That's not what the HTML5 spec currently does either but all input must have a well defined result I think that's the case in RFC 3339. If it doesn't parse according to the ABNF, it's invalid. the RFC contains ambiguous suggestions for letting implementations deal with 2 and 3 digit years precisely what part? if you are looking at http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc3339.html#rfc.section.3 Title: Date and Time on the Internet: Timestamps (at greenbytes.de) these are hints for legacy protocols that do NOT use RFC 3339 the ABNF clearly says ""4DIGIT"" how can the format be extended if usage of it is free to do whatever with invalid variants? so you're mssing a statement that if something doesn't parse it shouldn't be treated as a date? 60659cfda992013e610f285c46692d28, the 4 digit requirement clearly applies to producers. But for consumers that have to deal with 2 or 3 digit years from legacy apps, the requirements are largely undefined and implementations can do as they see fit I disagree. 60659cfda992013e610f285c46692d28, that'd be one possible solution I suppose but I'm just wondering what the strategy is if applications are free to do whatever they want I'm also wondering what the advantage of such a strategy is 60659cfda992013e610f285c46692d28, ""Programs wishing to robustly deal with dates generated by such broken software should detect non-numeric decades and interpret appropriately."" what does ""interpret appropriately"" mean exactly for a parser? again, I understand Section 3 as instructions for protocols that do not usethe RFC3339 format it would be more appropriate if the spec did define that non-conforming dates were to be ignored Otherwise: why would it say that before actually defining the ""right thing""? it seems to say most of that in order to justify why 4 digits years are necessary. But it unfortunately mixes it with poorly defined implementation suggestions (if the spec would say that anything not matching the grammar is not a date and should not be treated as such then that's enough error handling for it to be used by say HTML5, afaict, if it meets the other criteria as well) e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0, it doesn't meet needs of HTML5 for everything though e.g. HTML5 uses the Week format, allows 5 digit years, no leap seconds. The RFC does not",0

"hi do you have ps3? hi no Do you know Jesus Christ as your savior? no he is not jesus was a fudgepacker that's sad, why not? oh, I see, you're a ""mature"" one so why do you hate Jesus Christ? look jesus is a fictional character so i dont hate him why do you think that? I take it archeology and history are not your stron suits? i dont think *strong i know sigh dont give me that bullshit do you beleve in the old tesiment I see so you know the opposite of archeology and history? of course well there is a verse in the old testiment where god gives permission to moses to commit mass genocide lol and let me guess...... you don't know the verse? and the crusades where ""gods will"" but yet you know it's there no of course not the crusades were evil rhosands of people died all in the name of god a lot of things are done in ""the name of God"" doesn't meant they are right yes but religion gaives people the frame of mind to do thee things God said what makes him angry is when ""the people say The Lord says, but I have not spoken"" no read above Joseph Stalin was atheistic yes? yes and he killed 20 million of his own people more people have died through religion lol again.... do some research how many died at the hands of hitler? and in the genocide of aremanis *aremania Crusades..... roughly 5-700k died..... Joseph Stalin 20 million, Adolf Hitler 10 million, Pol Polt 2-3 million 3 major atheistic/humanist leaders....... look are you american? so your information is flawed are you american? yes I am, but that doesn't alter the facts the fact is you are a sterotypical american chrisian lol I wish you have no right to preach the word of jesus to me we wouldn't be in the cesspool we are now and you are blinded by faith of course I do no I am awaked to facts you are blinded by ignorance ok then you gonna /ragequit now? prove in facts and figures the existence of god ok..... where do you wanna start? how much do you know about science? i have a A grade high school qualification in science hrmmm. that should be enough........ so you understand about the 1st and 2nd Laws of thermodynamics? Law of Angular Momentum? well explain in context about how this proves the existence of god I will...... but I need to know if you understand the Laws..... I'll be happy to explain them to you if you don't because i think you are using complicated unrelated scientific terms to aviod the question lol I'll take that as a no..... lets start of witha statement of reality...... ok If the physical universe was formed naturally, then there must be a natural explanation to the existance of the universe... yes do you agree with that statement? yes ok, now are the Laws of physics ""created"" or ""discovered""? discovered right.... the Laws of physics exist...... we can only discover them not create them the laws of physics are there and we as mankind discover them yes that is the definition of the laws of phisics so the 1st Law of Thermodynamics or ""Law of conservation of matter and energy"" states Matter can neither be created or destroyed, only changed from one form to the other correct the 2nd Law of thermodynamics or ""entropy"" states that a system left to itself will expend all usable energy available for work .... over time yes ok now keeping these 2 Laws of physics in mind.... we know that the physical universe could not have created itself because of the 1st Law of Thermodynamics, also we know that the universe could not have always existed because of the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics... so there is no ""natural"" explanation to the existance of the physical universe therefore how we not know there is not a contradictory law that states a ""natural"" cause of creation say again? and even so using these laws doesn't prove the exsistance of a higher power such as god in a way it does saying we dont know how the universe began isn't proof of god we cannot just make up a fictional idea to fill in gaps in our undersanding of the univers if there is no ""natual"" explanation to the existance of the universe then there must be a ""super-natural"" (outside of the natural) explanation for the existance of the universe..... now this doesn't tell us what it is...... it only tells us that there is not a ""natural"" explanation to the existance of the universe yes but we cannot simply seculate that this is a ""god"" I understand.... that is just a start... now have you ever heard of Einstien's Gulf? just because our laws of phisics do not prove that a ""natural"" cause strated the universe we cannot say that a supernatural foce did you may not be able to say it because you are blinded no there is no proof for or against a ""natural"" formation of the universe it only shows that there is no ""natural"" explanation for it's existance of course there is proof I just gave it to you no it's called the 1st and 2nd laws of thermodynamics those are the facts we have in our current understanding now.... if you want to hold on to a blind faith that some Law will be discovered that contradict the known Laws of science there is no help for you you are forever lost in your ignorance yes but you are basing fact on ignorance",0

I thought Refresh was only supported by Gecko, actually oh no last time i checked i didn't find any browser not supporting it but i might have done something wrong by then interesting sees <meta http-equiv> used on more pages than <table>, but doesn't have any way to determine the attribute's values :-( assumes content-type and content-language are the 2 top",0

"hmm... Even when moving the dist war-file manually to tomcats webapp dir, it works. :( So obviously NB5.5 does something wrong when deploying. prolly netbeans is uber bloat ware heh It was the closest thing I came to an IDE with autodeployment out of the box. :-/ I can't believe I can't seem to find a consise bug report on this issue, I've had the same problem on two windows installs now.... wots the problem? Ensiferum, as I stated earlier, Tomcat can't seem to find jars under WEB-INF/lib when webapps are deployed from Netbeans 5.5 beta. ah beans :| but manual deployment by moving the war works fine and the issue is the same both for the NB-bundled Tomcat and a standalone install. Both 5.5.x I used the shared lib dir as a temp workaround, until I tried Struts. But Struts barfs completely on the config with errors that seems to revolve around the same problem. heya lyken abend yassine i love it when i run my kernel tweak script and my transfers go from 6-7MB/s to 10MB constant :) Guess I'll have to live with Resin for now then :( Fuzzy76, whats the issue ? When deploying from Netbeans 5.5 to Tomcat 5.5 Tomcat won't find jars in /WEB-INF/lib. But when deploying by moving the war manually it works. i guess NB is not packaging the war correctly its juts changing the classpath ? not as long as moving the war by hand works But I have no idea which mechanism NB uses to deploy. try unpacking the war file generated by NB and see if the jars are all in there they are well im not using NB but i _guess_ its juts changing the classpath and starts tomcat so that it knows where the jars are did you tried to export the project as a war file ? I used NB's build function which creates it so unzip that war file and see if the jars are in there as I said, they are but when deploying its not working ? yup. Says it can't match the taglib URI's and such. But that being said, NB 5.5 is beta. I might cross my fingers for the next beta which will be out in a weeks time if I understand their build system correctly.... But if I recall correctly I had the same (or a similar problem) with NB 5.0. But that again might have been because I didn't clean up after my previous NB5.5 install",0

I mean only the notifications of new issues when the are first created only that, not the follow ups value being the everybody in the group gets notified and can opt-in by heading over and adding themselves to the Cc in bugzilla if they care to follow the issue I think it would make sense if there's also first an email from you to the group instructing people to put techincal comments in Bugzilla OK too bad that Bugzilla doesn't track email replies to be clear, you mean to instruct people to *only* put technical comments -- no +1 messages or whatever? b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: I may be able to get that feature added if we actually start using bugzilla successfully then I could make a case for the need to our systems team a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: Yeah, technical comments only OK thanks Bugzilla's voting system is for +1 good point I will mention that in the instructions to the group I think it would be prudent to avoid suggesting that bugzilla voting were used as a criterion for taking stuff into the spec but it could be used as a criterion for prioritising what to deal with next (like the WHATWG issue voting system is supposed to be a vote on priority) yes, agreed",0

"88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762: I didn't have a better idea but zcorpan's idea is interesting Only seems worth it if there are other cases where it could be used though I think we want something that goes further than that: something that autogenerates tests for things such as [TreatNullAs=] as well as the property descriptor. Well the logical conclusion is something where you paste a whole idl block in as text and do test_idl() and it runs all the tests for you The question is whether it is useful to have a bit less magic than that and make people write test for different parts of the idl by hand I'm not sure what the sweet spot is between ease of writing tests and ease of understanding the output I guess sone can have both I think we just want to take a whole IDL block Optionally with a function that returns an instance of the interface if it doesn't have a zero-argument constructor Why a function? Just pass in an instance Well I gues you might need many instances b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: What does nose actually buy us in the html5lib case? Me not wanted to kill people? Also, more seriously, test generators are ideal for us Since we generate a bunch of tests from a data file it is totally natural to represent that as a single test function being called multiple times from a generator Eh, they make the tests harder to run (we appear to have almost a thousand errors currentlyâÃÂ¶), and that's only relevant for people changing the test harness code, which is almost nobody. Optimizing for people editing that code is the wrong optimization. Rather than the crazy thing we did with unittest where we built a class wih test_* methods at runtime I have hated that code more than any other code in the project for some time I agree that if there is a committed partial conversion that's bad and we should finish the conversion I believe that the default unittest in Ython nowadays can do everythign you need to get rid of that ugliness Show me where. I don't see it It adds test discovery but afaict not generators ""Tests grouped by a TestSuite are always accessed by iteration. Subclasses can lazily provide tests by overriding __iter__()."" That will still be ugly We will sill have to create a TestCase for each test at runtime And creating an object is so much worse than creating a tuple? Basically my problem with UnitTest is that it is a bout an order of magnitude more complex than needed, mostly for the benefit of looking like java there is clearly a difference between how http://livedom.validator.nu/ and http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/ are acting. is one considered more maintained? Which is not something I aspire to 4c681049601b3c374f1d2c0077c99049, they have different purposes 4c681049601b3c374f1d2c0077c99049: I don't think either are particularly maintained. But the validator.nu one I expect has not been updated recently (it uses a javascript implementation of the parsing algorithm) 4c681049601b3c374f1d2c0077c99049, the former is based on the validator.nu parser, the latter uses your browser a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554: The errors that I see have no particular relationship to the test harness I don't think ah uses a GWT compilation of the parser. cool. b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: Regardless, the output from parser tests of unittest was a lot more usable than what we get now from nose, and that's far more important I disagree. nose's output is better b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: With unittest we got far more readable identifiers for testse. Also I can't get nose usefully working with pdb at all :\ It puts me into pdb in a totally different place to the stack it gives me at the end, useful. Ergh, we're breaking relying upon non-documented behaviour. roc: hey, I want to go to bed, but the background works poorly because there's no color, and if you have a background set already it gets thrown away because of the current style rules; we could make background:black apply at the normal UA style sheet level of course roc: your description of stacking I didn't get because all the elements on a stack would be in the document roc: because the stack is document bound b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: Bloody hell html5lib is broken from a testsuite POVâÃÂ¶ And yes, I am bitchy about this. Because every time I want to hack on html5lib I invariably spend the vast majority of my time fixing regressions that others ahve introduced and would ahve found if they had run the testseuite. s/ahve/have/g a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554: Just as well it is as easy as typing nosetests now then I just fixed most of the error b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: No, it's as easy as installing nosetests and running it compared with just running runtests.py b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: And you did it a lot quicker than I did. If you aren't already using pip + virtualenv you have bigger problems b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: It's still an extra step. has never used either pip or virtualenv, and wouldn't know where to start ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: Obviously you have bigger problems then I have many problems I bet in practice you would start with google And bugs you need to get to 10 errors/8 fails b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: Le sigh, now I have a merge conflict from both of us fixing one bug. wonders how to get his repo back to the correct state Given the size of the bugs it can't have been more than one line Unless it was in test_sanitizer In which case you want my copy It was etree, because I wrote a far longer commit message :P And now I have two additional merges, and an extra fix. Why does hg have to be so hard to use!? It's not, it's just git brain damage I get the same Oh, no, now you've fixed the one issue I fixed while I was fighting mergesâÃÂ¶ b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: How do I find out what a push would push with hg? How do I revert to the remote head? I can't find any easy way to do either. hg outgoing shows what you would push b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: Nice of them to mention that in the hg push documentation. and hg update -r {revision} for the other thing Dunno if there is an equivalent of origin/master b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: That doesn't work. Because it's a parent of the revision I'm currently on. I can't actually get it back. WTF? I don't understand what you mean, but maybe --clean hg up -r e46af3a0f549 is a no-op. --clean doesn't help And help That's not what I was aiming for And e46af3a0f549 isn't your local HEAD? No, that's the merge of my fix for your last two commits and your last two commits. And I don't really want to push four commits that in total change zero lines of code. Because that's just fucking stupid. Enable the mq extension and hg strip them away? (note: may be dangerous) Bloody hell, how can this be so hard in hg? Well I don't really understand what you have done so it is hard to help my head is a commit which merges two heads âÃÃ® one is the current remote in the remote repo, one is an identical fix for the same bug which is local. The documentation claims that hg update -C -r works Bullshit. a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554@vanveen:~/Documents/my-projects/OSS/html5lib/python/html5lib/tests$ hg up -C -r e46af3a0f549 0 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554@vanveen:~/Documents/my-projects/OSS/html5lib/python/html5lib/tests$ hg log --limit 1 changeset: 1738:82a5ce2a85a4 http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2010/04/15/hg-reverting-committed-changes/ claims I have to clone the whole repo to do it. Wow. Okay, so now I've spent the past twenty minutes trying to push fixes that you managed to push because I was fighting hg, onwards! You really don't *need* to Rule 1 of the internet is ""don't believe blogs that are written by people who don't understand what they are doing and mainly sourced from 'facts' cobbled together on twitter"" Well, it was the best documentation I could find! Even the first comment is better documentation than the post! http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5833616/mercurial-getting-out-of-a-bad-merge And how do I run nose under Python 3? Unless I have two separate html5lib clones running in different virtualenvsâÃÂ¶ Just, wow. nose is *really* simplifying stuff. Huh? b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea, a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554, zcorpan: yeah, what we ideally want is something that parses a WebIDL block and generates a whole bunch of tests. But some things will still need to be tested manually, e.g., argument type conversion -- there's no way in general to figure out whether the arguments were converted correctly, or whether it's even safe to call the function with those arguments in the first place. Well yeah I guess any use of python 3 will require a different interpreter + set of libs Still, we could do a whole lot based on the IDL block. What do you think if i use data-* attributes in places where I used to use class=. These data- attribute names have more semantic meaning to the document than just presentation. eg <table data-meta> for tabular data that serves as the meta or abstract of the document. 88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762: Sounds like I have a project :) will now sleep b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: There's no simple way to get tests running under Python 3 and Python 2 without a lot of work using Nose. Without nose it was trivial. I'm confused as to what has happened to history as a result of that merge. Like, it looked fine locally, but now I'm just confused. Try ""hg view"" to visualise the repository, maybe? isn't familiar w/ hg view If you're familiar with gitk, it's that That makes it look a heckuva lot cleaner than Google Code does. tends to use hg glog",0

Most of it was just trying to figure out the filledRectangle syntax. we don't draw gradients with a lot of rectangles we pass them down to various native libraries Ah, I see. Damns. just started from the bottom. I suppose we could approximate squares etc with linear gradients and clipping Hmm, maybe that'll work. you really want them implemented as close to the graphics hardware as possible, for performance (gradients in general, I mean) That won't help us solve the 7th gradient-shape I wanted, though - box (shape of the box, taking into account border-radius). ;_; Though, to be honest, that's not as useful now that I don't skew the gradient. we should define a new SVG Filter for that I really just have no idea what can be done with SVG. I need to learn up on it. actually with feMorphology erode/dilate you can kind of approximate the effect the only bit of heroism I'm considering is adding -moz-repeating-linear-gradient and -moz-repeating-radial-gradient, since they'd be really easy 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: Gavin > Garrett That's a long name, but sure. I still don't like the idea of other background properties leaking into image generation. Making it explicit is better. ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: ? (alphabetically) ooh 1adba86c435b5fe0f7ea043370b1636b: I think they're wrongly ordered in the credits section alphabets are hard 042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427: But I do like the idea behind repeating gradients, so I'd be happy to see them in there. What would be the effect, though, of -moz-repeating-linear-gradient(red, blue)? (Since, for a normal linear gradient, that defines a single sweep from red to blue across the entire height of the gradient.) s/height of the gradient/height of the box/ I'm in the credits? what for, I wonder oh, it's not me! 1adba86c435b5fe0f7ea043370b1636b: You're not the only person in the world called Gavin ;-) it's Gavin Carothers hate that guy Because he stole your name? yeah Good a reason as any to hate somebody 042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427: Also, I assume that -moz-repeating-linear-gradient(red -10px, blue 50px) repeats with a 60px period? yeah Hmm. Is that equivalent to linear-gradient(red -10px, blue 50px, red 110px, blue 170px, ...)? no red -10px, blue 50px, red 50px, blue 110px? it's equivalent to linear-gradient(red -10px, blue 50px, red 50px, blue 110px, ...) k, yeah. That makes better sense. so you get an abrupt transition when the starting and ending colors are not the same Yeah. but I think that's OK, it's pretty obvious what to do to get a smooth transition there Yeah, and I can put an example in the spec for it too. and you might want the abrupt transition I guess sure. Possibly more in radial - I dont' think I'd ever want it to be abrupt in linear. But there's no reason to prevent it. 1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb: a couple more questions, if I may trouble you... Go for it. ""In certain circumstances it is impossible to determine an appropriate ending-shape from the given parameters; in these instances the gradient image is just a solid color, defined by the last color-stop in the list. The following combinations of values will trigger this: closest-side if the starting-point is on a box edge, closest-corner if the starting-point is on a box corner, ellipse and closest-corner if the starting-point is on a box-edge,"" in those situations, the shape is simply a circle/ellipse with radius 0, isn't it? Yes. Which is also ""a solid color, defined by the last color-stop in the list"". ok, I suggest you rephrase ""it is impossible to determine an appropriate ending-shape"" then Hmm, okay. there' nothing really inappropriate about an empty circle or ellipse Well, it's sort of a degenerate circle. Equivalent to a point. yeah Depending on who you're talking to, degenerate shapes aren't valid. ^_^ I'll rephrase it, though. ""and finally ellipse and either closest-corner or closest-side if the starting-point is outside of the box."" I don't think we need to call out degenerate shapes in the spec, unless the spec demands behavior for the degenerate shape that is different from what you would get applying the normal rules That last one really is an error, though. There's no way to determine the dimensions of the ellipse in that case. there is suppose I'm using closest-side Unless you extend the lines defined by the sides outside of the box, I guess. right You can attempt to infer that, but I don't say anything that would make that required. I dunno if it's useful but it's what my code does I'll have to add extra code to detect the outside-box case to match the spec as written Yeah, I had to do so as well (my code didn't gracefully handle it, so it was required anyway). so I suggest changing the spec to make that the behaiour any recommendations for tutorials/demos of the canvas element and images? Hm, k. I'll see if I can do so gracefully. more specifically, i'm looking for effects. I think it probably would be useful, e.g. it means you could animate the movement of an ellipse into the box by animating the start position oh wait, that wouldn't work so I dunno :-) Nah, it'll collapse to a line as it crosses the box-edge. ^_^ I mean, you could still use it when it was outside of the box. You'd have to use color-stop positions greater than 100%, but still. I just figured using farthest-side/farthest-corner was equally useful. 042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427: Doing the animated ellipse thing would be doable relatively easily with an explicitly sized SVG gradient, and animating the background-position. yeah 1e3432d592a0aaf5feab78537496ce24: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Canvas_tutorial 1e3432d592a0aaf5feab78537496ce24: effects? 042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427: I'm heading out to do some yardwork, but I'll stay in the channel and be back later.

From what I understand I thought Oracle managed this automatically. you can hint it to load a table in to memory alter table cache; which will suggest to oracle that it may be a good idea to load it in to memory ""which puts the database tables (from disk) into RAM. "" he is telling me some code of ours is telling oracle to do this. Mr_You, You can use a KEEP buffer it puts a HUGE hit on the database. alter table storage (buffer_pool keep); .. but it shouldn't be abused for all tables you think should be cached this is the scenario... db is updated, they run a script which nails the database causing it to ""put this stuff in memory"" which then the DB changes show up. oracle is quite good when it comes to the automatic stuff especially in 10g yeah which is why I'm confused. it's a typical burelson thing whats that mean? ))) donald burlesson has a professional dba consuntancy... he thinks he's the king of everything oracle related he likes to make up cool stories so he can get consuntancy time to go to client sites and spend a few hours ""tuning"" like rebuilding indexes ever 6 hours I think I've seen that site. burlesson suggest to have a batch job on the db server to ""identify"" all tables that ""have to be"" in the keep pool... and automaticly buffer then in this case, the changes aren't being seen til they run this script, who knows what they are doing/why... its a bunch of crap code. i love it when tom kyte talkes about burlesson I'm wondering if they aren't committing changes until the script is ran and maybe for some dumb reason, the script is nailing the database to make up for some crap that happened in the past. i mean its not a bad idea to actually put tables in the keep pool this has existed since Oracle 8? no idea... at least since 8 ok hali, there is quote about Burleson?) <a href=""http://asktom.oracle.com/pls/ask/f?p=4950"">http://asktom.oracle.com/pls/ask/f?p=4950</a>:8:17753972428972245717::NO::F4950_P8_DISPLAYID,F4950_P8_CRITERIA:2913600659112 search for ""scientist"" I'm sure DB is an ""expert"" based on the definition: - experts CLAIM things - scientists PROVE things DB being donald burlesson :) yeah hello good evening... guick question: is there nay easy way to determine why an oracle insance is bogged down in a write operations and what is causing them? hali: heh hali: it seems that we might be using temp tables improperly. improper temp usage? i've seen that ... where temp just grows and grows in this case they are creating temp tables to put things in RAM. from what I understand. im not sure i follow thats just weird they do a lot of weird crap err.. weird or umm... plain stupid. to get easier access to processed data? i can understand if they create materialized views to get faster access to processed data ""easier"" access to static data from what I understand. that could make sense well, if there is a performance benefit. but i would never use temp tables.. materialized views do exactly that.. and you can even schedule it to update automaticly yes but right now having to update the TEMP table puts a huge hit on the db. yeah if it is based on a semi-slow query and there is no need for realtime data not sure. Either way it doesn't sound right to me. but you get the view log overhead on the tables under it.. but that should be close to neglitable at least if you want fast refresh, which im pretty sure you do :) this is something thats always been there since they use to use 8.1.5 ... its just been moved to 10g. this place is a joke, I gotta find something else. or do a hostile takeover lock yourself in the server room with a big gun I've been attempting that. and tell them to sort it out they just don't get it AT ALL. there is zero real management here. new people are leaving. or have left. the only people that stay are those lucky enough just to have a job in this field. hate those anyway. im off... l8er l8",0

"wrapped code is cross-platform, yes it's hashed by a proprietary algorithm you mean database procedures, etc? wrapped pl/sql code packages, procedures, functions, etc. yes, that should be cross-platform. i can't think of anything off the top of my head that would be platform-dependant normallon one wraps the package body normally leaving the package speck readable spec i'm not a big fan of that i'd rather have the source so i can custom modify and report bugs, etc. wrong I""d rather have it wrapped on the custoemr end leave a copy so YOU Can see it but distribute the wrapped code elsewhere i hope i never have to buy your product it prevents unauthorised modifictions our entire ERP system has open code and for me, that makes life great i don't have to sit and wait 2 weeks while a vendor tries to explain what the code is supposed to do that's bad, in my opinion, as I've worked with systems like that and the end-user has added code to packages and procedures i can go look we add stuff all the time then it becomes a support issue and you have an agreement with the vendor that you can change whetever you like in the code whenever you like i don't know. i don't read the contracts. either way, we do it. the vendor doesn't support it, so... you chould, if you're jacking with the source code so you lose your support license and if you fuck up the app you're on your own good thinking i just find that obfuscated code doesn't gain as much as people think, and it hinders people like me it's SUPPOSED to hinder people like you who screw sith code you don't understand like i said... i hope i never have to work with any of your products no, you don't understand certainly I do you jack with the source when my organization needs something to get done today, we can't wait for the vendor to react you lose support licening you could open yourself to a lawsuit all because you think you're smarter than the vendor we've been working with the vendor on a *very* minor modification to another system it's been 2 months i could have completed it in about a week so? they have more than just YOU to consider and yes, sometimes i am smarter than the vendor... remember, i get to see their code not if you lose your support agreement, violate your licensing and end up in court either way, the point is moot you'll never convince me that your opinion is even close to correct for you, maybe that's just peachy nor i the same to you i think vendors need to quit being so scared i can see the xfs code in kernel, but i think, i will never edit it :-) but if i know, how it work, i can use it knowledge. hell: if it works, why even bother :) ""never argue with an idiot. they will bring you down to their level and beat you with experience."" therefore, this discussion is over black box things a very cool, while they work :-) jackfig: thank you for the personal attack. that shows a lot about you. the packages supplied by Oracle are wrapped THEY won't let you get in and 'dick' with their code and i don't need to modify Oracle either i need to modify our administrative systems and i do oh, i go home, boys :-) and life is good like i said... it is moot",0

"dfefdb66581190514404f57cdf74a8eb: I'm not really sure what point you're trying to make dfefdb66581190514404f57cdf74a8eb: I wrote this so far Yeah, usually only the editor has a solid grasp of the entire document and that is why questions are typically directed to the editor. The editor is also the person who reverse engineered behavior / did research, wrote the whole document, and takes the input from all the people in the acknowledgments section combined and deals with it. With regards to feedback, in my experience dealing with it is often more work than giving it. but I'm not sure why I bother catches up Anne, you bother because you are good at what you do :) thanks, but I meant with the thread I don't really have a point (apart from Spec creation is a collaborative task)âÃÂ¶I have an opinion: I would like to not have editors listed at the top of a document (as I think all contact should be done through the WG list). I agree with your summary of what a spec editor usually does. ah, I almost never get direct email, other than for typos I get a few every now and again my drafts have ""Participate:"" a little higher at the top now http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/xhr/raw-file/tip/Overview.html that's true, and that's a nice addition I'm hopeful that with the spec redesign, people will get a better set of signs pointing them to where they can participate BTW, a friend of mine is making the template for Community Groups. He should have a prototype soon.",0

"The only reason I can think of for having <article> is to prevent accidental search results when the search keywords are spread across multiple <article>s that happen to be shown on the same page Because search engines can't know what <div class=""some random value representing an article""> means, but they can know what <article> means but, well, blah Reducing the number of <div>s in the world is not a useful goal that problem could be solved with microformats as well (and I'm not saying everything can be solved with microformats) how can it be saved with Â¬Âµf? *solved class=""hentry"" on a block element that is an article I'm <div class=""hentry"" id=""the-8th""> I am, I am, I'm <div class=""hentry"" id=""the-8th""> I am... SorryâÃÂ¶ not following you there :D http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I'm_Henery_the_Eighth,_I_Am ah, haha 15bc6e4578edf59ea5e901ffb83c59dd: but people make up class names, someone might (oddly) use hentry. people don't make up element names (normally) That's an argument against microformats in general, not against <article> in particular a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554: yeah, that's why I actually suggested something like role= (which is similar to class, but predefined, with clear semantic meanings for each value) I think it'd be better to not meddle with classâÃÂ¶Â¬â  how are unknown attributes treated? %Text? 15bc6e4578edf59ea5e901ffb83c59dd: I think the selection of structural elements in HTML5 (and the lack of footnote, note, comment, etc) is partly justified by http://code.google.com/webstats/2005-12/classes.html - it's trying to cover all of the most common cases, though I guess the cutoff point is largely a subjective choice is back 15bc6e4578edf59ea5e901ffb83c59dd: i think there are several reasons for using elements rather than attributes for article &c 15bc6e4578edf59ea5e901ffb83c59dd: (1) it's easier to author and maintain markup with element names instead of lots of divs 15bc6e4578edf59ea5e901ffb83c59dd: (2) if we continue reusing div for anything new this way we would end up with DivML 1.0 or something after a while 15bc6e4578edf59ea5e901ffb83c59dd: (3) it prevents the case where an element is both an article and nav at the same time, or where the attribute is placed on bogus places 73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46: (1) You could keep on adding new elements for anything that is used a lot 73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46: (2) using new elements breaks in some browsers, while role=... or class=... does not and I have no 3 yet 15bc6e4578edf59ea5e901ffb83c59dd: (4) it's more performant to process elements than attributes in the general case (look at the headings and sections section for how article is part of the document outline algorithm) I simply think the amount of new elements is too much I like <m> and <section>, but I don't think it's worth adding 10 more elements (2) i don't think it breaks anything (the content is still accessible as if the tags weren't there, no different from say <label>), it just isn't possible to style in some browsers HmmâÃÂ¶Â¬â  I remember someone mentioning a workaround for that in factâÃÂ¶ I've never seen it though why is it better to use attributes instead of elements? as i said, it would complicate processing, so i don't think using attributes would make the language simpler in any way one workaround is to use xhtml5 :) another might be to fix up the dom with script afterwards HmâÃÂ¶ what about the predefined class names, thoughâÃÂ¶ what is the reasoning for not putting them into a separate element? Hm, they are more like 'properties' of existing elements I suppose they can apply to multiple elements yeah it could be argued that we should combine all sectioning elements (except body) to just <section> and then use an attribute for what kind of section but i'm not sure what the advantage would be There's still the difference between <div> and <section> which isn't entirely clear If you could add aâÃÂ¶ say, type=""header"" attribute to <section>âÃÂ¶ the entire page would be <section>s, with very few divs indeed... i think this needs to be pointed out very explicitly in the spec... in a nutshell div doesn't affect the document outline so you end up replacing <div> by <section> which is pointless section is not intended to be a catch-all replacement of div clearly but i fear many authors will go ""oh, section is the new div, i should replace all my divs with sections!"" q.v. b->strong yeah I do believe many div's could be replaced by section's though sure here's an experiment: http://simon.html5.org/sandbox/html/w3c-home-in-html5 Yeah, I did something similar with my site a few days ago Perhaps I simply haven't used html5 enough to judge the use of new elements What is the reasoning for giving presentational elements a semantic meaning? there isn't much that can be used today in practice :) that too whow http://simon.html5.org/valid-html5.png with cat inside 8-) :) that's probably the biggest reason why I switched backâÃÂ¶Â¬â HTML4 is stable and predictable met__ 15bc6e4578edf59ea5e901ffb83c59dd: probably to not upset the semanticists or so wouldn't it have made more sense to deprecate the elements instead? that will make em and strong be the de facto italics and bold elements but they already are Redefining b, i, small, etc gives me the impression ""b, i and small are no longer uncool, and you can use presentational markup again!"" HmâÃÂ¶Â¬â the use of <article> could actually bring back this old ""subscription"" feature IE5 hadâÃÂ¶ see http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2007-January/009060.html You'd bookmark a page, then tell IE to check whether the page had been updated or notâÃÂ¶ but that doesn't work on dynamic pages unless the actual content can be extracted which is possible with <article> (anything outside that could be ignored) indeed 73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46: ah, interestingâÃÂ¶ trying to force authors to use semantic markup doesn't work, they will instead misuse semantic elements for presentational purposes additionally, semantics is not an end of itself, it's more a means to achieve device independence 73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46: that raises the questionâÃÂ¶ why have four elements instead now (i, em, b, strong) if the more ""semantic"" ones are supposed to replace the more ""presentational"" ones? (or the other way around) we already have 4. why forbid one pair of them? Because they have different meanings. well, <i> and <b>'s meaning changed Yes. To something that makes more sense. da5121879fff54b08b69ec54d9ac2bf6: in practice, you can't differentiate between <i> and <em> in an app that extracts semantics, and the benefits of differentiating them on the consumer side is questionable so i'm with hsivonen (it took me a while though) How would WYSIWYG editors differentiate between <i> and <em>, and <b> and <strong>? they don't So they could use <b> for important text, and <strong> for bold? That doesn't seem to solve anythingâÃÂ¶ you can use either for any purpose of why you want bold you want bold for a purpose, but most authors don't think about the purpose or they do but they don't want to mark up the purpose they just hit command-b and the reader gets the purpose because of the context search engines can't extract anything useful here I seeâÃÂ¶ Why do <strong> and <b> still have different meanings, then? In written Norwegian, titles of books, magazines, newspapers, movies, records, TV programs and plays are to be displayed in italics. 15bc6e4578edf59ea5e901ffb83c59dd: because Hixie isn't convinced yet, i think :) Those italics are not emphasis. And they are not really presentational. da5121879fff54b08b69ec54d9ac2bf6: indeed da5121879fff54b08b69ec54d9ac2bf6: but italics there has a semantic meaningâÃÂ¶Â¬â it's not italics because it's pretty When we have an element that does the job (<i>), there is no point in requring the author to use <span class='title-of-book'> or some other nonsense. 15bc6e4578edf59ea5e901ffb83c59dd: Exactly. indeed seems we agree :) now i gotta go again seeya cya Which is what the HTML5 spec says. <i> is used to markup âÃÃºa span of text in an alternate voice or mood, or otherwise offset from the normal prose, such as a taxonomic designation, a technical term, an idiomatic phrase from another language, a thought, a ship name, or some other prose whose typical typographic presentation is italicizedâÃÃ¹. nods You wouldn't write something like this eitherâÃÂ¶Â¬â  the <span class=""noun"">title</span> of a <span class=""noun"">book</span> <span class=""verb"">is</span> <span class=""adjective"">italicized</span>. silly example really You just mark up what's necessaryâÃÂ¶ marking up the title of a book as a separate class doesn't make sense unless you somehow want to do something with a list of book titles No. I would write âÃÃº<i>Menneskehetens rikdommer</i> av Leo Huberman er en bra bok.âÃÃ¹ which is pretty much why I don't like the introduction of header, footer, section, aside, article, nav, dialog, âÃÂ¶ because usually it's not necessary to explicitly mark them up that way It might not be neccessary. But it is very useful. Especially <article> and <section>. Apart from less keystrokes and readabilityâÃÂ¶ what is the use of <header> and <footer>? yeah, I like <article> and <section> Standardization. I can tell my web browser to don't bother printing <header>s, <footer>s or <nav>s, because they are not useful on paper. But you could simply tell your browser to display the contents of <article> instead. That is also possible, I guess. But standardization of commonly used classes of elements is useful anyway. Both for page authors and browser vendors. Standardization for standardization's sake doesn't make a lot of sense though Standardization makes it easier to write and parse documents. the use-case of <header> is mainly subheadings (that shouldn't be part of the document outline) ""footer"" was a very common class name shouldn't be here Ahh, hm these elements also remove the need for skip links an <article> element would eliminate the need for skip links as well though <article> and <nav> mainly Sure. But why _not_ standardize the most commonly used classes? footer is the most widespread class on the web. http://code.google.com/webstats/2005-12/classes.html elementitis :)",0

"hi How does one save the uv map template in 2.42a?

I must be doing it wrong. <Helixgruven> in the UV/Image Editor press the button UVs and then select <Save UV face Lay Out> Right, that button isn't in there for some reason. Lemme screen shot it. Do you have Oython installed? You have the bf blender install Helixgruven Python Yeah. Lemme just restart blender real quick. If its not there you must have a special cvs version 2.42a. Well, I'll try it in 2.41. I just opened mine Helixgruven its there If you don't have Python installed you will not get this cause it's a script. sudo su - root python -V Python 2.4.2.

I keep a binary install of 2.42a, but it yeilded the same results. Perhaps it isn't finding the python script. anything else is probably a specialize version that had had some specialize coding done to it so that it has extra features and probably a few bugss the script should be installed when blenderis its part of the bf install /download open up a scripts windwo and click upday menus I used the ebuild, so I'm not sure what all came with it.

Although, had this worked I would have saved time by now -) Helixgruven what are you building Finally. or rather what are you making with blendr For some reason, the scripts weren't copied. I just copied them from the release folder. What was weird was that some of there were there, others weren't. Right now?

"c53ce266132145423a95034f111ad7dd, yeah, it's a new feature edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: Is your nextNode stuff intended to be correct if the filter function manipulates theDOM? edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: is there an open Opera bug ticket for document.innerHTML or should I file one? b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea, when ""iterator collection"" is mutated referenceNode and pointerBeforeReferenceNode need to be updated, that is not defined yet b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea, however, once that is defined it should be alright c53ce266132145423a95034f111ad7dd, I can't find one so fast, feel free edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: done Mozilla: http://bugzil.la/563320 WebKit: http://webk.it/60316 IE: https://connect.microsoft.com/IE/feedback/details/680040/implement-document-innerhtml edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: Yes, I suppose that would work. And the detached flag. Although if I understand your intent correctly, it doesn't seem to match existing browsers http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/1080 In particular it seems they stop if they encounter a node they have seen before, but don't set pointerBeforeReferenceNode b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea, what about the detached flag? edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: Maybe I don't understand what it is for Why do you check it after the filter function? What causes it to be set? b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea, the filter could set it by invoking detach() b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea, which reminds me, the current algorithm does not handle recursive invocation either b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea, I don't really understand the results from your NodeIterator btw b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea, it has SHOW_ELEMENT set yet Gecko and WebKit (not Opera) are happily returning Text nodes The text node never gets returned, but it does get set as the referenceNode doh, I should read better (which also doesn't match the spec I guess) Can that situation only occur at the end of the collection and during modifications? I could modify step 3.1 to account for it I imagine that internally they update the referenceNode irrespective of whether the node matches the filter So you would just need to move that inside the loop I think it is only observable after modification or at the end though that does not work if something throws an exception if you update referenceNode all the time and filter throws an exception or sets detach() it will have the wrong value It seems to get set to null in that case Oh, only in gecko In WebKit it seems to be the node that you were trying to filter So you could set referenceNode to node at the start of the loop And set it to null if an exception was raised or detach() was called? And that makes the whole thing no longer function? http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/1081 is what I looked at It does not even throw an exception in Gecko? oh it does you were not printing that if you just do throw ""x"" referenceNode does not become null it is only null when things are detached so invoking detach() just initializes referenceNode to null so you can clear up resources silly legacy thing thanks for helping out btw Hi I'm trying to implement CSS parser, but it's rather hard for me to understand some of the regular expressions used in specification e.g.: \\[0-9a-f]{1,6}(\r\n|[ \n\r\t\f])? is there somewhere a document written in human language that would explain which strings are allowed for a given token? other than the CSS specification and its dependencies? I do not think so so I will have to read a book on regular expressions in order to understand the specification? :/ no something on yacc I have to implement this with javascript afaik there is no such tool like yacc that would generate js code Well you will likely need to understand regexp, yes And there are some parser-generators avaliable that will create javascript But your chances of success if you don't understand the input seem rather small there is peg.js, but it genarates the whole parser (I just need tokenizer) Well I would read http://flex.sourceforge.net/manual/Patterns.html#Patterns and convert to javascript regexp also, CSS2 and CSS3 specifications seem to be using slightly different tokens e.g. there is BAD_STRING token in CSS2, but I can't find it in CSS3 specs CSS3 is out of date ironically enough edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: should I implement the tokenizer according to CSS2 specification and later update it when there is new revision of http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-syntax/? or perhaps I should use http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-syntax/ as the only reference? b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea, so I tested again and I think referenceNode only becomes an ""invisible"" node due to modification c63a5cfce0a1819ebbe4a19e074356b6, you should use CSS2 with modifications c63a5cfce0a1819ebbe4a19e074356b6, css3-syntax is hopelessly out of date ah recursive calls throw an exception as well in WebKit some kind of callstack exception in Gecko INVALID_STATE_ERR in Opera the same as in Gecko in WebKit invoking a different method (e.g. previousNode) does work, it does not in Opera/Gecko I guess I'll side with Opera/Gecko simplicity ++ specs++ name for this flag? ""locked flag""? wfm yeah, whatever For detach(), s/initialize/set/? I use initialize for readonly attributes because they cannot really be set I'm not sure that is better Initialise implies that it is being set at the point it is created better term? set just seems wrong but maybe we should use it anyway lol http://xkcd.com/927/ for now: http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/domcore/raw-file/tip/Overview.html#dom-nodeiterator-nextnode edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: Better than initialise. I think it is understood that the redonlyness of attributes from the external point of view doesn't matter to internal algorithms hi all, does anyone know of a browser that supports the scoped attribute on the style element? b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea, done Anyone an idea how to generalize 3.1 and 3.2 so we can have one algorithm for nextNode() and previousNode()?

"hi hi how can I refresh a TreeView using pygtk I have to use a thread ? I need auto-refresh I may be wrong, but doesn't calling gtk_widget_show_all refresh its contents? dunno about py syntax happen that I need to run a function every 1 second, this function load the data into the treeview there are timer things found in Glib 1 min yeah I know if I use a button that's no problem but I need do that when the app starts without blocking my app why can't you set a function to be called every second then? because my aplication seems locked blocked exist some signal to call this function when the app starts ? there are signals that are called when a widget is created wich one ? I need a signal for my main gtk window activate_default ? I don't see any obvious signals I need run a function every 1 second when the app starts :( the other way it's to create a thread I think <a href=""http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.2/glib/glib-The-Main-Event-Loop.html#g-timeout-add"">http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.2/glib/glib-The-Main-Event-Loop.html#g-timeout-add</a> it's called a timeout with g_timeout_add_full () you specify the interval in milliseconds probably yeah great happens that I'm using PyGTK, now I need to know how to do that with it there an api reference? I'm searching on www.pygtk.org <a href=""http://www.pygtk.org/pygtktutorial/ch-timeouts.html"">http://www.pygtk.org/pygtktutorial/ch-timeouts.html</a> <a href=""http://www.pygtk.org/pygtk2reference/index.html"">http://www.pygtk.org/pygtk2reference/index.html</a> Snarius, thanks! I just realized: there's no creation signal a widget needs to be created before signals are connected :) :) there is a ""show"" signal tho",0

"69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: what's a character not defined by unicode? from the document conformance section, it seems that not all non-characters are yeah, but some of them are defined to be permanently undefined whereas others are merely not yet defined oh, wait. I realise what I'm mistaking. i'm so sorry for anne. he's somehow ended up editing a spec with multiple phone calls per week trying to tell him what the spec should say sure am glad i dumped xmlhttprequest now though :-D xxFFFE is the only code point that's always a non-character, as FDD0 to FDEF are only exactly that that's what confused me eh? there are lots of non-character characters FFFF FFFE U+03FFFE etc see the list i just put in the spec, in fact :-) I thought it was wrong, that's the only point :) ok :-) but as I said, I'm being silly well i just copied it from xml 1.0 so... I think FFFF is legal it's not ""Noncharacters consist of the values U+nFFFE and U+nFFFF (where n is from 0 to 1016) and the values U+FDD0..U+FDEF. "" OK, I'm wrong again (and so is my implementation, then) realises his implementation is just too smart for himself my implementation _is_ right. `($codepoint & 0xFFFE) === 0xFFFE` does match FFFF or rather, it does match it but yes that's a fine check If you aren't too tired to misread it :) (that's from my PHP impl., FWIW) Or rather, It only is if you aren't too tired to understand it ergh. I can't even do English :) gives up, and shuts up knowing when to shut up is a good skill to have :-) 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: I would rather the bit about when to throw a parse error to be clearer. Surrogates _are_ defined by Unicode (they just have no character assignments), for example there are no surrogate characters unless i'm misunderstanding you what is unclear about the spec? ah. true. if you take it of the actual meaning of character, yeah. was thinking of a character as being any code-point, but of course with non-characters that's dumb shuts up, again U+.... is the character, not the value as it was in the original byte stream so if you are decoding as UTF-16, you can never end up seeing a U+.... character from the surrogate blocks yeah, that's true needs to wake up and if you do it as UTF-8, and you see one of those characters, it's not actually a surrogate character, it's a non-character (or, alternatively, just go to bed) but anyway where is the part fo the spec that says not to put encoding declarations in the file? can't find it didn't know the spec said that apparently people want me to remove it which i'm fine with but i can't find it... latest revision to the spec could cause some documents to cause a heckuva lot of parse error, me thinks. but people manage to create a heckuva lot of parse errors anyway. 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: s/occurances/occurrences/ in a recent edit hate that word thanks 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: by ""encoding declarations in the file"", could people be referring to ""<meta http-equiv=""content-type"" content=""text/html; charset=utf-8"" /> "" ? 6905646aa63b96d6bdfbd256603fa58e: yes on the subject of English, how is the spec both en-gb-x-hixie and en-us-x-hixie at once? a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554: it's mostly -us-, i just haven't fixed the declarations yet they're in a different file are people confusing that being allowed with that being required? 6905646aa63b96d6bdfbd256603fa58e: no, i'm pretty sure i once wrote that people should use Content-Type headers instead but i can't find it anymore well, can't find it oh well",0
"hey please tell me your normal I am most days. I have been acussed of insanity before though hahaha we all have at some point what are you doing on here? just looking to chat? yeah i am peer editing a paper I dont want to hence omegle ahh! i seee this website kind of bothers me everyone is soo perverted and wants nude pics i'm like wtf well, sometimes I play along with the horny guys that ask me if im a girl. They are pretty dumb and dont pick up on it hahahha meee tooo! me and my friends always do that and i always get a picture first to see if they're hot haha i never get a picture I dont trust the stalkers on this site i'd never give my picture out to anyone. and now they have omegle chat and i just find that SUPER creepy to video chat with some random person yeah. I would have to pull a chat roulette and dress in a costume hahahaha that's the best! soo funn what grade are you in? what kind of paper are you editing? you? 10 and a paper on reaganomics same! but i have no clue what that is lol cool and its just the economic plan that Ronald Reagan implemented when he was president ahh haha you must be smart to be writing a paper about that well, it is kind of an easy paper. You dont have to go very far in depth. and this isn't mine. I am way too lazy to do anything with politics truee that! your a girl right? nope are you a girl? yeahh your a pretty chill guy then thanks I do my best. I have actually observed that girls are more high strung than guys, but thats only my opinion i actually agree with that a lot i tend to get along with guys more just because of the fact that they dont care about drama and they dont judge you like girls do thats true. I go to an all guys school, so I have to get along with guys no wayy? do you like it? yeah its actually a lot easier to focus on it. plus because its only guys, you make really good friends there i bet. did you get sent there as a punishment? or were you okay with going? I got sent there because it is the best college prep school in our area. plus my oldest brother really wanted to go ohh sweet! do you play any sports? I play basketball, but I wasnt good enough for my school. so I play in a rec league and by myself a lot. you? i play softball, volleyball, and lacrosse lax broskie what up mhm:) Hahaha. I love lacrosse players so chill haha they're the bestt for sure I just have a lot of friends on my schools team and I hate on them a lot for being a bro hahahaha is your school's team any good? um. I think they are technically still a club, but they are decent. They shouldve won state last year that's how it is at my school too. we're just a club and i'm on varsity but i dont get a varsity letter so it suckss well you get them from softball and volleyball yeah but still if i play all 4 years of highschool which i've already done it for 2 years thats an extra 2 letters by the time i graduate very true. But me being unathletic, it doesn't influence me as much. Though I do understand the sentiment hahahaha what state do you live in? wisconsin. you? florida cool here the women are great looking down there :P hear*",0

I think it's because you don't know what you're doing and if you DO get this to work with 'DBA' then you'll need to go through this same process AGAIN when you assigne PROPER rights to users hmmm... using DBA to 'end run' around assigning proper permissions is stupid ok, i removed the rule dba and the privilege sysdba HUH??? now the user have only create, update and delete table, index and prcedure privileges <a href=""http://tahiti.oracle.com"">http://tahiti.oracle.com</a> <=== I'd start with the Concepts guide and read ... hmm... ok, but that don't quickly resolve this problem, for learning oracle i ordered three booky by amazon. i'll read them, but this problem i need to solve now then you absolutely need to read up on PL/SQL and the AUTHID function authid... ok, i'll google for this at tahiti.oracle.com you do that or so ^^ and this 'problem' has arisen due to your lack of understanding of how Oracle functions hmmm... there are complete books online on this site taking 'shortcuts' won't fix this hmmm... i wrote an insert and update trigger for this view and both are working so??? yes if the executing user doens't HAVE delete privilege on the table no delete trigger will work guess you didn't think of that ... there are threee triggers, one insert, one update and one delete. inserting and updating are working SO????? the USER can have INSERT AND UPDATE direct grants i understand without a DELETE direct grant on that table the DELETE trigger WON'T WORK problem... without the trigger the user can delete data from table SO A SESSION uses the ROLES assigned PL/SQL OBJECTS DON'T ahh I TOLD YOU THIS EARLIER too bad you couldn't pay attention hmmm... I'd be off at tahiti.oracle.com reading instead of trying to argue with your insufficient knowledge of Oracle ok, i'll search a little bit around there thank you",0

"my new cooler has white stuff on the contact surface... do they sell them with thermal paste already applied or something? BCMM: yes. ah well, because i didn't expect that, i seem to have accidentally wiped a small part of it off. Do you think it will matter? Should i put some more thermal paste on? BCMM: if you got better contact material you can scrape the existing one off with a credit card or other plastic (not hard) thing. hmm.... is Arctic Silver better than whatever comes on a standard-looking cooler for an intel? BCMM: if it is a little bit don't worry. BTW, if it is thermal paste it will have come with a little foil to protect it. BCMM: there is a long debate as to that. I usually prefer Arctic Silver. BCMM: the Artic Silver web site has some really good illustrated instructions on how to scrape off the existing paste and apply it. It is simple, but better do it the right way. Blissex: no foil, but stupid plastic cover which needed a bit of force to get it off the cooler's legs that's sort of how i smeared it thanks, i'll check their website presumably, it's less of an issue of computer failing and more like if i do it right it stays cooler, right? BCMM: yes. thanks a lot BCMM: if done badly it is about the same as the paste. Done well, it is 3-4C cooler. well, hopefully after this bit i'll just be doing stuff i've done before fixing old machines and not need more help... thanks Blissex: do you think cardboard would be ok for wiping the old paste off? BCMM: cardboard wont damager, but not wipe that well... The edge of something like a credit card is soft enough and shape enough. thanks... ! BCMM: but you can use cardboard and then a cloth with some non-greasy no-deposit solvent to wipe off the last. the edge of the pack the arctic silver came in would do... oh god... i don't have any solvent stuff... i'll just scrape it i think thanks BCMM: well, uses kitchen soapy thing and then rinse it well and wipe hard.",0

Wouldn't it be treated as #00a000 if the keyword wasn't supported, or something like that? oooh, good point Compare http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?%3Cbody%20bgcolor%3Dtransparent%3E vs http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?%3Cbody%20bgcolor%3Dtransparenx%3E indeed ok In IE6, the former looks white, the latter looks #0000e0 so can anyone think of a way in which browsers differe in their handling of <body bgcolor=""""> (empty) and <body bgcolor=""transparent"">? http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?%3Cstyle%3Ehtml%7Bbackground%3Ablue%7D%3C%2Fstyle%3E%0D%0A%3Cbody%20bgcolor%3D%22transparent%22%3E In IE6 it looks white (whereas bgcolor="""" looks blue) well making it map to body { background: transparent; } isn't going to solve that problem... I see quite a number of pages with bgcolor=transparent mostly on table elements, not body but http://windows.radified.com/ has it on body Can someone try emailing me a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554.com? ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: can you find a difference between bgcolor="""" and bgcolor=""Transparent"" on <table>? the bgcolor=transparent on that site seems useless risks getting even more hated by the rdf community 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?%3Cstyle%3Etr%7Bbackground%3Ayellow%7D%3C%2Fstyle%3E%0D%0A%3Cbody%20bgcolor%3Dblue%3E%0D%0A%3Ctable%3E%3Ctr%3E%3Ctd%20bgcolor%3D%22%22%3EA%3Ctd%20bgcolor%3Dtransparent%3EB%3C%2Ftable%3E That's not table, but it's close :-) throws 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e some hatred (http://philip.html5.org/data/bgcolor-transparent.txt is all the bgcolor=""transparent""s that I see) (and http://philip.html5.org/data/bgcolors.txt is counts of total occurrences of values) sees a bgcolor=""#(hex code here)"" ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: Can you get the latter list ignoring all conforming values a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554: I don't know what's conforming a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554: but you could easily work it out and filter the list yourself :-) ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: See: HTML 5 ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: No, I'm lazy. :) a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554: Me too :-p I know :P I knew it was in vain. Hmm, maybe I should have sorted the bgcolor list in a proper ordering rather than whatever fancy English collation it's doing by default uploads a new version of bgcolors.txt, now with all the #s grouped together, which is much more sensible ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: what does IE do with that test case?

Haven't finished it though, as it was rather long... f5bc1b9935e1d202f67b23f2238afb95: :) a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554: regardless, found it though provoking f5bc1b9935e1d202f67b23f2238afb95: How long was the draft I sent you? 5000+ words Ah. That doesn't help :) hehe The final copy was 4494, IIRC (the limit was 4500) cool, send it :) why do they make you write soooo much? that's really bad (A draft I had on the day before I had to hand it in was exactly 4,500, but editing it to make sense in one or two places made is a bit less.) University assignments in australia are usually no more than 2000 words. An honours thesis is around 10,000 Here university assignments are frequently around 5,000 As someone who worked for a number of years as a university lecturer, I seriously doubt any of that is actually getting read As someone who is a son of a university lecturer, I can tell you it is. My dad is also a university prof. :) Well, my department we were all slackers... more interested in doing real research then wasting time with deadshit students :) Yeah, my dad keeps getting in trouble trying to do research, which he is meant to be paid to do a quarter of the time :) (Primarily because they expect him to do a crazy amount of admin too) yeah, that's another problem at unis. They got rid of all the admin staff I'm glad I left academia. I hate that place. One fun thing is his contract spells out that it expires at the end of the university year after he turns 65, and also defines what university year is. What the university year is nowadays is no longer what is written in the contract hehe, so what is it? And he has no intention of staying after his contract says so So he'll be leaving after the second week of term! nice (of the first semester) Of course, he doesn't need to tell anyone he's leaving then. I mean, they all know: it's been in his contract for the past 30-odd years! I don't think my old man will ever retire... he has taken up an environmentalist cause after 20 years of producing patents for the car manufacturing industry (But, undoubtedly, they will be surprised at him leaving after second week, but that's the university's own fault) hehe He's retiringâÃÂ¶ so he can do research, such is the sad reality of universities nowadays What area does he work in? French Esp. medieval French he is a linguist ? Indeed ah... nice. shepazu is a linguist too :) Interesting that the son of a linguist didn't dabble into the semweb :) or maybe it makes sense :) I'd say I avoid linguistics but that isn't strictly true shit, I got a conference paper to finish. There is no avoiding it, you work with markup languages, programming languages, etc :P Linguistics is a beautiful thing. You should read some Chomsky :) Oh! and a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554, I got a bone to pick with you about your atheist extremist comments on FB Before you judge us too harshly, you should read God is not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything by Christopher Hitichins (better read than Lolita, though just as many pedophiles!) hmm... the above might sound weird without context. goes to work on paper for Africon 2009 about widgets :P",0

"3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d: ping cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c: pong 3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d: i sent you email 3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d: i like most of the new logical property stuff but i hate the terms ""measure"" and ""length"" would rather go back to logical-width and logical-height heh I would prefer length, but I can't come up with an alternative to measure line-direction-length, block-direction-length that's not making it less akward anyway the reason i like logc ical width and logical height awkward is that the code in webkit stays very readable like you can still stare at layout code and see it talking about the logical left of a line or the logical top + logical height etc so someone just reading it can kind of filter it out and just think horizontal lines anyway just giving my feedback. like the other stuff. i think logical-width/height are good terms though and should just keep them especially if we do the logical keyword for shorthands k I mainly put them in to see the reaction :) hm, speaking of which, I need to cut that entire section out so I can requestion FPWD s/ion// there's really two aspects to these terms (it's bedtime here) there's the css properties but then there is what term you use all over your code i guess the two could be different but i like that they matched (logicalwidth property, logicalwidth term etc) ok i won't bother you night :) hm, not seeing your email i just sent it to you not to thel ist yeah, that's where I'm looking... You could make them match either way It's just a problem that the only alternative to width is breadth, which nobody can spell right remembers to check the other email address lol i just think logical-width/height are fine terms 3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d: i sent a post out about the baseline issue with details about wjhat WinIE does from what I heard at TPAC, what WinIE does isn't necessarily a good idea but I don't remember the details all I know is, I need to spend a couple days writing up that section I have a fuzzy idea of how it's supposed to work from talking with some of the Adobe guys at TPAC so I'm going to work that out and see if what I understood all fits together but basically, my approach is to not touch the vertical-align property's default and define baseline behavior for vertical to behave appropriately for textual contents but koji said something about ... oh bother I don't think I can say anything intelligent right now. :) lol i was going to suggest just doing the right thing when you encounter ideographs on a line that's the plan ""just do the right thing"" 3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d: do you think image list bullets should rotate with thel ine it's a matter of figuring out the right thing and making a coherent spec out of it :) or render upright is converting lists right now cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c: interesting question i honestly have no idea i am inclined to just keep them upright like other images cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c: I'll need to look into that cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c: but they probably should rotate for the rotate-* orientations cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c: for vertical-right... cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c: I think it makes more sense to make them text-combine: horizontal (or whatever the final syntax will be) i think a japanese author would assume they would render upright (specifically referring to image bullets only) OH yeah images should stay upright if we need images to rotate sometimes, we should add appropriate syntax to the image() notation in css3-images which we probably will do such functionality has been requested by the bidi folks for rtl (technically those would flip rather than rotate) k cool",0
"b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: Oh, whoops, I haven't done anything about duplicate attributes (I guess html5lib hasn't either, since it passed that test) Looks a bit irritating how it says to drop the attribute value before you've actually got an attribute value at all... tries to think of a nice way to handle that ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: I have a boolean flag ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: and I defer the actual addition of an attribute til the value is complete or know not to exist ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: which was also the source of one class of test case failures you found Adding another state variable makes other things more complex (like when verifying you never have to alter an attribute unless there actually is an attribute), so it'd be nice to avoid that if possible (Well, it's fine to add a state variable into the C++/etc implementation, but preferably not into the conceptual model of the algorithm) ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: So do you want html5lib commit access (hint, hint)? would someone like to volunteer to check an email about bikeshedding, belling the cat and economics 101 for suitability of sending to public-html? in particular, checking whether it is offensively patronizing? b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: Oops, I forgot to respond to b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9's second comment - I expect it would be good to add these tests to html5lib (which is why I named the file test3.test already :-) ) at least once I've fixed the bugs, and added manually-written tests for the other bugs I have in my code ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: I went ahead and gave you commit access whether you wanted it or not :) b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: I just saw that - thanks :-) wonders if it matters that his test cases don't have good descriptions ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: I think I've fixed issue 50. Your testcases would be most welcome now so I can have some confidence that I did the right thing And also because I promised them in the commit log :) Just trying to fix the duplicate-attribute issue, which hopefully won't take long :-) Descriptions are good but probably not essential - the treebuilder tests are all description free, for example But if you can add them, please do :) I have no idea what most of my test cases are doing, so I don't know how to usefully describe them Maybe I could convince the test-generating program to work out why it's choosing those particular ones, but that seems like more effort than would be worthwhile ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: I guess if you keep all auto-generated tests to their own file it's fine notices he changed something and forgot to run the treewalkers tests hmm. I guess I just send the message at the risk of offending some people b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: Go for it. At least then we'll get email about how offended people are rather than whether or not Anne should include all his optional tags which is probably the most boring thread ever ;) b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: sent enjoy: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2007Jul/0507.html was I too offensive? b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: Committed the new tests now ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: Cool including one with duplicate attribute values, which html5lib fails b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9's implementation passes all those tests now) b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: No, I don't think so. Possibly a little terse, but if people read the links they should get the idea (I'm just reading the joel on software one which I don't think I've seen before) likes b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9's terse style Hmm, the html5lib Ruby tokeniser doesn't seem entirely happy with EOFs (resulting in various things like <""undefined method `+' for :EOF:Symbol"">)",0

"has anyone made a graph of the normative references between the specs that browsers implement? phrased differently: I think I'm going to make a big interactive map of standards! woo :) hello folks. The W3C validator gives me ""Bad value for attribute action on element form: Must be non-empty."" because I use <form action="""" ..> the url is computed by the authentication engine and contains variable parameters. Is there any way to work around the validation error and still maintain a ""post to current url"" behavior? action=""."" because ""."" means ""this location"" and "".."" means ""one dir up"" would that preserve parameters? which parameters landing to http://site.com/path/?next=foo , would action=""."" send to http://site.com/path/?next=foo or just http://site.com/path/ ? the latter. if you want to preserve parameters, add them to your form using ""<input type='hidden' name='monkey' value='banana'>"" why in the sky was this constraint introduced? you could write some JS to do this automatically based on window.location because arguments are single time things I will just ignore the validation outcome for that part. if I call ""index.html?lol=rofl"", then relative links are relative to my page. not to my page+args 0de37da1d654c10aed33d7b7347b8e3b i never knew that about form action action takes any legal URL, and ""."" and "".."" are legal URLs for ""this dir"" and ""parent dir"" which is why action=""index.html"" and action=""./index.html"" do the same thing a20e0580519fa0e9092d058a67627726, if you have a form that needs to preserve the arguments, simply use a bit of JS to extend your form, or modify the action. <form action=""?I=maru""....> on a page ""index.asp"" will call index.asp?I=maru, for instance. So if you want to explicitly encode arguments that way, that's also fine are you serious? :P come to think of it, action=?"" might even work, although I never tried that O_o yes, when you want to break out of the default model for how HTML works, any recommendation I do involving ""write some JS"" is pretty serious =) I think W3C has to revise that constraint, or introduce a conventional representative for ""current URI"" no most definitely, so I'll break it :) exactly, so break it with well written JS say I go to index.html?user=pomax and there's a relative link to ""test.html"" where should it go? ./test.html?user=pomax? 0de37da1d654c10aed33d7b7347b8e3b: I think both you and I have better ways to spend time :) I don't know, you're asking a question, I'm answering it, if you think that's a waste of time, something went wrong =) I think it's great that you have thorough and dedicated. And I think this constraint is short sighted think of it this way: arguments are not HTML and I represent industry, which cares about practicality. This is not practical, here's my answer to W3C: I'll just break it. they are instructions to the server. which means that your server can do something with them, to generate content. that includes making sure that content that needs to further use them in links, has them right there. it's your responsibility. if you're using PHP or something to accept those arguments, then you get to write the code to inject them into the form that gets generates for that page. it's pretty simple that way 0de37da1d654c10aed33d7b7347b8e3b: short sighted. Think of a login form, where ?next=X is the landing page after it. Params are just the right way to do it it has nothing to do with the page's own content, yet it needs to be passed on you're missing the point. where do params *GO* if you have plain html content, they don't go anywhere, argument parsing is not part of HTML, it's part of ""server-side handling"" so that's where you make the magic happen. no doubt I can do it with machinery. I just deem it unpractical. and that's how new technology is born. Hello, I'm drawing some elements onto a canvas - everything works fine in desktop browsers, but when i load it on the ipad, i get no errors - but nothing drawn on the canvas. I've done some logging and the the code appears to be getting the 2d context. Any have any ideas? c5c4e16354e3a5e00f5dfc21328c2573, don't have an ipad (sadly =) but have you tried reducing to see if it does simply draw instructions like a plain canvas with some rect/paths? 0de37da1d654c10aed33d7b7347b8e3b, if I create the dom manually - and get the element by id, it works fine. But building dynamically appears to be the issue, i thought it was a timing problem, but the context is available when I draw - and all elements have been appended to the dom - going strip code out I think, has to be something silly with some luck it'll turn out to be.",0

"b246ff693d453c3b1a3049752da2bc75, yes? hey b246ff693d453c3b1a3049752da2bc75, you being on the other end of the world and me going to bed at reasonable hours does not make this easy oh, you're here :) so, i was thinking of implementing parts of cssom view particularly, the API to query media rules cool! i didn't know you'd written that spec http://webkit.org/specs/MediaQueriesExtensions.html was what i was going to do (see section 6) aah, I saw that and wanted to e-mail you about it :) but your approach is better ta now.. i have comments not on that one but we need the point mapping APIs to be able to take transforms into account we already have implemented some methods for mapping a point from a node into page coordinates (custom methods, currently only on iphone) doesn't it take transforms into account autometically? i'd assume hit testing does not assume nothing is transformed... in our case we need to be able to map an arbitrary x,y point into page coords sure, hit testing gets extremely complicated with transforms (especially 3d) we make sure elementAtPoint and so on works e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0: trying to find the documentation on what we implement kk, when you say arbitrary x,y point into page coords do you mean arbitrary x,y point on the viewport into coords for the canvas or something? right and the other way around interesting see the end of the CSS Transforms spec now on w3.org!! we add a Point class and then add this to Window: Point convertPointFromPageToNode(in Node node, in Point point); Point convertPointFromNodeToPage(in Node node, in Point point); your CSSOM View api is one way only and also does bounding rects are remember that with rotations, things are not rects or you want more accurate than a rect you want a quad make sense? I think I still follow, yes so, do you think you could add in methods to allow us to do conversion ? it would be nice to have Point and Rect interfaces would it be ClientPoint, effectively? could be doesn't matter that much actually, probably not it's just Point, nothing clienty about it :) I suppose in convertPointFromNodeToPage it is relative to the element the definition of getClientRects() still works for transforms right? i.e. there's still a bounding box yes euh, border box but that isn't always useful when there are transforms eg. rotate(45deg) yeah, so we need new sets of methods? i think so getClientCoordinates() or something? we have one internally on the phone that returns a list of four points and have ClientCoordinates class which takes a list of points four is always enough? it's important to do it in one method call because there can be a lot of ugly math involved (building up a set of matrix multiplication) to JS though we only provide the method for a single point so you only have the APIs you listed above, nothing like getClientRects() ? yes correct and you're saying that having something like getClientRects() that takes into account transforms would be painful so you rather have the Point API? basically, we need something like convertPointFromPageToNode and the other way around too getClientRects is from Node To Page make sense? and we're sort of implementing this in public webkit at the moment, so there is a little time pressure :) yes, I'm just wondering whether we want your approach or a simple extension of what we have now we don't particularly like our approach e.g. now we have elementFromPoint() and getClientRects() but we needed to implement something for iPhone 2.0 we could have elementFromPagePoint() and getClientCoords() or something like that yep, sounds good. or maybe just getBoundingClientCoords(); will you ever have multiple boxes? although, it isn't just about getting the element say, you want to position an object under the mouse but that object is in a complicated set of nested transforms what you need to know is, what top/left (or translate) do I need to put the object in the right place or, the other way around so you have a viewport coordinate and an element and you want to know how far they are apart? you want something at the top level of the document to track the position of something deeply nested and transformed you have a viewport coordinate and you want to know what that corresponds to in the coordinate system of a child note that SVG, the greatest specification ever to have been written, has something like this too ooh, can't we juse reuse that API? looking it up http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/types.html#InterfaceSVGLocatable e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0: that has the helpful functions, like getTransformToElement and getScreenCTM that would be enough since you can get the inverse to do the reverse mapping however, there is a small snag with 3d transforms, in that you can't always describe the transform as a matrix (if there has been flattening) that's why we pass points ie. the matrix might be impossible to generate, but we can apply the same logic of the transform to the point to get the result so they won't work? i think they are a great idea in general, and work perfectly for 2d stuff but don't always work for 3d e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0: what if we talked about it internally and sent you a proposal? to www-style or something the only problem is that they return SVGMatrix yeah, that'd be great please tag it cssom-view [cssom-view] fancy new features or something we were hoping you'd have an solution right away but obviously you are useless haha the good news is that we are equally useless meanwhile, i want you to fix the CSSOM asap it's horrible wow yeah, I agree, wanna take over? is sort of heads down changing Web security policies no, i don't i don't even want to do the specs that I'm actually implementing :) if I had my way i would erase everything and start over yeah, would be much neater if bytes actually consisted of 10 bits actually, i was thinking 0 bits much much easier true, if we could go that far back maybe make sure humans are perfect right from the start so we don't have to go through all this comittee trouble",0
"hey all, Im trying to get authentication in my servlet. I want so use username:password from an xml post. So I can't use forms auth, and I can't use the http headers. But I would like the container to do as much for me as possible. any ideas? azzz, im afraid i did not understand what you exactly need Inside the xml that is posted to my webservice... contains the username and password. I want to use these values to authenticate against the tomcat-users.xml realm azzz: You either have to write your own custom authentication that you call from your servlet, or you have to tinker with Tomcat internals from within your servlet (potentially done via JMX). hello-new to chat. I am using the HttpServletRequest if i do response.setHeader(""status"",""500 Internal Server Error""); the send site get this. However the access log shows 200. where do I look to see how I can change this jasonb, I eventraully wont use tomcat-users.xml.... I will use ldap... I have code to talk to ldap directly already... so I would assume JMX / Tomcat communication would be a more complex exercise with the same outcome azzz: Depends on how you mean that.. but maybe. oops HttpServletResponse res.setStatus(this.httpStatusCode); azzz: Something wrong with JAASRealm for ldap use? thanks jasonb, nope. I avoided it else where because I was modifying ldap values... but I could use it here jasonb, what's the advantage of a JAASRealm vs JNDIRealm ? If you dont mind me asking azzz: You're asking that because they could both be used for ldap auth? yes azzz: It's probably true that either of them could be used for LDAP auth. I actually get them confused a bit, maybe for that reason. :) I probably should have just mentioned JNDIRealm to you earlier. I think JNDIRealm is more tailored for LDAP. And, JAASRealm is more complex and has had a bad service record. azzz: I'm not a fan of JAASRealm really, but I'm also not a fan of LDAP. sounds like there is no perfect solution :) Well, there is: don't use ldap. :) container management is a bit nasty for me... because the xml I use for submission is very complex and I would prefer deploying as little as possible to the common/lib directory I need ldap, this has lots of accounts thanks heaps for your help! azzz: You're quite welcome. I guess if I were you and I had to use ldap, I'd probably find a way of instantiating my own JNDIRealm and calling it from the servlet. that's what I've decided to do... plus I have already written such code :) Oh, wonderful. How did you handle loading the JNDIRealm classes? env.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY,""com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory""); you mean that? hack the planet ! oh.. you didn't use LDAPRealm, you went straight for the JDK's ldap code.. which probably is better. well, I was modifying ldap. found that easier that way",0

"c480405f460f7a61964569640a6cd059: it seems like your example with relative urls would actually work. maybe I am missing some subtle detail of how urls are resolved. aboodman: the url would be resolved against google.com though, no? 7d8a20281bb41e05c504c371880f1d08, rather than against example.html it seems like it would resolve to http://docs.google.com/documents/report.doc right which is the same thing it would resolve to relative to index.html, assuming index.html was also hosted somewhere on http://docs.google.com/ index.html is hosted on myserver.com sorry, should have said that cross-origin workers aren't allowed in html5 i thought cross-origin loading of js files are i hope, no reason not to they will execute in the security context of the loading page though same as for <script> huh consults the spec i know the original spec didn't allow it, but i thought that was a bug i don't see why we would disallow cross-site loading of the script file since <script> already allows it ""If the origin of the resulting absolute URL is not the same as the origin of the script that invoked the constructor, then throw a security exception."" bah that sucks workers aren't really the same thing as <script> tags i think that is part of where our mental models differ i agree :) for dedicated workers they are very similar workers are like pages just out-of-process importScripts() is like <script> tags and you can't communicate with windows that you open that are in other origins so i see dedicated workers as simply an out-of-process <script> where you offload stuff you don't want to execute on the UI thread yes, you see them like threads. i am not sure how to resolve this difference in seeingness i think it's a difference in use cases bah, gotta take off for bus, i'll be back on in a few mins ok i will keep typing as i will probably have to go soon too quicky first though: you had suggested that we support appCodeName way back when. Is that one really useful? everyone returns 'Mozilla' heh you mean on the navigator object that is exposed to workers? I just figured that we should support the same API that windows support. no reason to make things incompatible just for the heck of it. there is already code that works with the navigator object. windows support a loooong list https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM/Window.navigator right, I guess I assumed that exposing things to workers was not a lot of extra work. i was hoping to not do the whole thing it is hard to know what people are using today. if you take a look at the code that libraries use to figure out what browser is which, it is crazy. since everybody lies about who they are, it kind of has to be. ah, i was hoping you had some data on that when you originally posted 5 of them :) ok, rally taking off ok. have a good weekend",0

"Quick question, is there a cheap and easy way to normalize whitespace using some DOM method? 056705610ffb1726be04db950e5feebe, http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/core.html#ID-normalize Title: Document Object Model Core (at www.w3.org) Thanks f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: Does that do what 056705610ffb1726be04db950e5feebe wants? f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: that one normalizes text nodes--not whitespace in them I'm basically wanting to normalize textContent... but I guess I need to define what ""normalize"" means in the context I am using it. (I'm not aware of a DOM method for doing white space normalization) yeah, I didn't think there was 056705610ffb1726be04db950e5feebe, it's not clear what you mean by whitespace normalisation exactly, as I said above :) I guess I want to collapse all space characters and tabs into a single space, remove any CR and LF. ok. A regex should be able to do that 056705610ffb1726be04db950e5feebe: don't you want to first turn tab, cr, and lf into spaces, then collapse runs of spaces into one yeah, but I'm specifying it for the widget spec (e.g., the name element needs to use something like that) yeah, that might be better b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 then remove spaces from start and end 056705610ffb1726be04db950e5feebe: http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/relax-ng/spec-20011203.html#IDAQFAS Title: RELAX NG Specification (at www.oasis-open.org) Ok, I have the following spec'd: 1. Let input be the element to be processed. 2. let result be the value of the textContent [DOM3Core] property for input. 3. In result, convert any U+000A LINE FEED (LF) and U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) characters into a U+0020 SPACE. and Tab? 4. In result, convert any sequence of more than one U+0020 SPACE or U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION (tab) with a single U+0020 SPACE. 5. Return result. I should do Tab also in step 3? 056705610ffb1726be04db950e5feebe: that leaves single tabs unmodified 056705610ffb1726be04db950e5feebe: so yes ok, makes sense great! thanks for the help! 056705610ffb1726be04db950e5feebe: Why not skip step 3, and say something like ""replace any sequence of one more space character (0020, 0009, 000d, 000a) with a single space""? that could work too If I was writing it as code, I'd just say 's/[ \t\r\n]+/ /g', rather than 's/[\t\r\n]/ /g; s/ +/ /g' I see your point. 056705610ffb1726be04db950e5feebe: also, you probably mean to remove leading and trailing whitespace Ok, will add that too.",0

"587bf8b858e15d03428e1415c33c38ef: you there? well, sorta; I like for people to give me a few keywords when they ping me so I can evaluate the priority of the request vs. other stuff I'm doing. what's up, b406b22e31ce6e541c3754a7214cec1c ? oh, sorry. I'm not listed at http://www.w3.org/2000/09/dbwg/details?group=40318&public=1 I noticed that mu inbox got less mail than usual Or should I contact someone else? I take it you joined the WG at some point? Yes mail stopped at 3rd it seems do you remember when you joined? I'm having trouble finding record that you joined first week or something when Hixie posted the details on how to join ah... 9 March. found it some part of the email infrastructure mangled your surname or maybe our WBS forms thingy hmm... then on 27 Jun, opera nominated you. Yes, I was a summer intern the robot usually sends me mail when somebody leaves. I don't see anything about that. is stumped mail stopped 3rd Sep? or 3rd Aug? September actually, it might have been 28th of August. Sorry well, I reported the problem to the W3C systems team by email, with copy to you Thank you very much for taking the time welcome. if you have that sort of problem when I'm not around, Karl can help. his office hours and mine mostly don't overlap he handles most of the signing-up stuff, actually. ok, thanks",0

(Well, sure, it is, but if you want to ship it in normal softwareâÃÂ¶) Performance is ""not re-distributable"" We'll obviously have a PHP drop-in replacement A userland tree implementation can have decent performance, given some concessions on the tree-builder and API side Decent enough, at least, for anyone who wants to casually use the library What would be nice would be to get DOM to do no checks when strictErrorHandling = false What's more likely to happen is that userspace SimpleTree will blow up memory usage (not that DOM doesn't do that already, but you can't see that if you profile) a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554: We filed a bug on that a long time. Didn't work. *a long time ago Didn't work in what way? Hi, can anyone tell me how websockets will handle/support binary data? Will you be able to download the bytes of a jpeg through it and load it in the DOM for example? eventually, yes not in the first version though As in, they were like, WONTFIX, and proceeded to add the check for the place they missed Let me dig up the bug (we had this conversation before) http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=44648&edit=1? That's the only thing I find looking for http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=44648&edit=1 Ya, that's it *strictErrorHandling Clipboard fail. I got told that it could be doneâÃÂ¶ if I wrote the patch. Which is all fine and wellâÃÂ¶ if it isn't for the fact I don't know C. :P It's not that difficult a patch PHP insulates you sufficiently from actually C-ness The hard problem is figuring out how to compile PHP I couldn't work out how to get the strictErrorHandling property Hm. If I could work that out, I could probably write a patch :P That's slightly non-trivial Anyway, I still argue, that's not tenable for the sake of portability How so? Older shipped versions? Yep Agreed, but in the longer-term it would be nice to be able to use it. Sure. I wonder if SimpleXML does checking... In places. does anyone have basic websocket support now? :-( wishes they would fix XMLWriter so you could actually rely on it outputting XML. An XML serialiser that outputs XML? I think you're asking for too much http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=41800 See, it's not a bug! a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554: If you want to take a stab at it again (I probably won't have time for it this weekend), the first thing you'll want to figure out is whether or not it's something stored in the PHP layer, or the libxml layer eca88ce0deea1275223afe139b2595e2: I don't care enough. I have too many bad experiences to think I have any chance of it ever being committed. http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=44619 They're going to fix it The Right Way! No Really! More seriously, adds XMLWriter grips to his list of problems with PHP *gripe I think the PHP dev community is not too receptive about patches unless you bug them a lot about it *gripes You will almost certainly not get a patch that big into PHP5.2. Maybe PHP5.3 a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554: Are you foolishly expecting the XML serialiser to deal with the issues of encoding data so it can be serialised as XML? Clearly that should be the user's responsibility ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: I am expecting an XML serializer to always output something that meets the document production in the XML spec. It's a bug that they've even got any methods other than $xml->write('<test>blabla</test>') 09bbaca4ac9c0978a8287a7d28999985: webkit and mozilla are working on it, i believe eca88ce0deea1275223afe139b2595e2: I bet you 5.3 will be in commit freeze by the time I get around to anything like writing a patchâÃÂ¶ (It's up to you to make sure the data is encoded properly) So, if PHP didn't have binary strings by default, this would make sense 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: great, I guess I'll wait patiently for a bit :) eca88ce0deea1275223afe139b2595e2: s/by default/always/ 09bbaca4ac9c0978a8287a7d28999985: you and me both! Well, if most of the strings whizzing around are UTF-16, and then I want to put a binary string into the XML writer I'd say it has two options: refuse to do anything with it, or base64 encode it 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, huh, here's a video claiming minefield has WebSocket support ... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrV9jJQn_MA ""Fixing it"" so that it's well-formed UTF-whatever is totally not the correct behavior. eca88ce0deea1275223afe139b2595e2: I'd expect it to die. And then, you can't even do that the smart way in PHP, because it doesn't have any notion of types So this won't get fixed until PHP 6, when we get Unicode strings 09bbaca4ac9c0978a8287a7d28999985: that's a demo of the work they're doing, it's not in yet i don't think PHP is currently operating an abstraction level too low And this is a leak.

"wishes there was an http://h2vx.com/ equivalent for microdata 1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f: I would assume the only difference is whether it shows up with document.getItems 4d2a769942601baa26f55634a8eb251b: but nothing supports the API yet right? I don't know, but probably not and even then shouldnâÃÃ´t all items show up? getItems explicitly says it only returns top-level items When I last looked, if I remember, top-level status affected RDF conversion too (it adds a triple from the document to each top-level item) oh interesting. thank you both (non-programmer so these API things are a bit of a black box) s/remember/remember correctly/ (It was probably a year ago and it's probably changed and/or I've probably forgotten the details) another microdata thing that is confusing me is <meta content="""">. I know that current browsers pull <meta> into <head>, but last time I asked here the suggestion was to change to a <span> and hide via CSS wouldnâÃÃ´t it be fine to just add an id then use itemref to refer to it? again I expect thereâÃÃ´s probably some API/implementation issue that meant whoever suggested the hidden span hack to me not suggesting it, but not sure 1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f: I don't understand the problem at all. The browsers that move meta to head are also browsers that don't support microdata anyway And presumably meta in body will be fixed before or at the same time as microdata support being added in a given browser 4d2a769942601baa26f55634a8eb251b: you could be using the microdata via an external JS library like metadatajs although your point is valid for the microdata API Ah, didn't think of third party libraries well, thereâÃÃ´s only one ;) In that case, wouldn't using an id cause the creation of a subitem? The span solution keeps the structure the same I donâÃÃ´t think thereâÃÃ´s any requirement for itemref targets to be items. they can be just a property like <meta id="""" itemprop="""" content="""" > IâÃÃ´m really surprised that the API only returns top-level items. does that mean a tree or does that mean nested items are hidden?

I thought the ieft hybi mailing list would've been a really busy mailing list.. turns out it isn't much at the moment 1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f: Nested items are properties of the items they are nested in 4d2a769942601baa26f55634a8eb251b: aah, yeah thatâÃÃ´s what I thought. thanks It's like a tree, except I think we established at some point it's actually a DEAG *DAG ? hitting the wall. thanks for your help 4d2a769942601baa26f55634a8eb251b A DAG is sort of like a tree, but the branches can merge back together Because multiple items can refer to the same subitem 4d2a769942601baa26f55634a8eb251b: nice explanation, thanks nn all 4b5f96b5acaa36dc96cebf4c5a1598dd: long time, no see. 4b5f96b5acaa36dc96cebf4c5a1598dd: goodmorrow fine sir.

"marcos, got a sec for http://www.w3.org/mid/<email/> ? artb, yeah, we are talking about it in #wam for now, I just want to talk about the XHR req and its use in A+E k When I read the req, I think it's OK. It doesn't say which spec will satisfy it in fact, WebApps may never write a spec that says it will be satisified right? but some other SDO e.g. OMTP could make a spec Regarding this req and section 3.1 of the A+E spec and XHR depdendency, if it said MUST I'd be concerned but with the SHOULD, it's not clear there is a problem here i.e. why change what is in the spec? because it puts an API dependency that is not required and that we are not going to fulfill We should take it out we have two extremes on the table: 1. include all APIs and Specs and 2. abstract everything (current approach) so let me ask this question -> does any part of the A+E spec, as defined in the latest ED (March 26) Require XHR? Artb, yes, I think it says ""a UA must implement XHR"" ""In addition to this specification, a user agent SHOULD support the following specifications: * [XMLHttpRequest]"" well, it was a ""should"" not a must Yes, I see that but I'm asking if for example any of the methods or attributes require XHR If the answer is NO then I agree text you quote above should be deleted But deleting the related requirement is a separate issue And you wan to delete "" * [Widgets-Updates]"" too, right? You are correct, no method in the A&E depends on it. There are methods that depend on [Widget-updates] [[ OK - I think we are on the same page here i.e. we both want to delete from the A+E spec the following: In addition to this specification, a user agent SHOULD support the following specifications: * [XMLHttpRequest] * [Widgets-update] ]] attribute Function onbeforeupdate; attribute Function onafterupdate; Seems Arve deleted update(); I thought we had a discussion about ""Which specs depend on Updates?"" and the answer was ""just P+C"". I think we should trash those two methods they don't make sense anyway You can update a widget while its not running so those methods are unreliable If those two methods are deleted then then the [Widgets-Updates] ref can be deleted too? right I'll propose it Why remove the related requirement? for XHR that is? in the abstract e.g. for defining a useful ""Widget UA"", it is a reasonable requirement It just doesn't appear to be a requirement that is satisfied by A+E spec where would that requirement be addressed? In a ""Widget User Agent"" spec, I presume Seems that you get XHR for free if you implement HTML5. But if you use flash, you can use XML Sockets or whatever Did you say OMTP is defining such a spec? I can't comment on that right now. :) they may or may not do that. I'm not sure.",0

"I see text/plain e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0: exactly e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0: btw, have you seen chaals lately? or corresponded with him at least? I'm wondering if he's planning on sending out any kind of draft agenda for the webapps f2f I saw e-mail of him :) I recommend e-mailing, I believe he is in Oslo will ping e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0: thanks e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0: btw, what was the reason for 350ms? Why not 200 or 500? for XHR progress events I implemented a ""progressbar"" using progress events, and adding support for 350ms made it a bit jerky perhaps I should test with a bit smaller value... 150 or something bb21c722adad611b63dfb48ec99e8350, 200 and 500 are allowed, no? :) bb21c722adad611b63dfb48ec99e8350, I copied this straight from the <video> spec a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2, hmm, just now read the e-mail, weird e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0: the ""BITSY"" e-mail, you mean? the one from Nikunj Mehta something close to 50ms looks nicer. that's a lot of events queuing up though queuing? it still batches quite a few events 135 events without timer, 22 with 50ms, 3 with 350ms (just a quick test, depends on the quality of this network connection) 135 events without timer? right when downloading that ofc depends on the implementation how often network layer informs other participants that something has happened i see in the test I'm uploading and downloading 1MB is there a visible difference? I think the use case for <video> is a bit different there is visible difference in my progressbar k, so we do 100ms +- 50ms or so for XHR? 100ms looks quite ok 12 events hmm, but there should be some reasoning for the value ideally the value would prolly depend on download speed and size of the downloaded object so you get less events if you download, say, an order of magnitude more though events are cheap yeah, and it probably depends on what you want as an app dev 50ms would allow 20 frame rate I'm fine with 100ms fwiw, I'm ok with recommending 50ms as well and leaving out the +- thing i'll e-mail the list ok, thanks",0

"I'm not sure I have a clue what PReP or CHRP is, although those acronyms(?) seem vaguely familiar. peerce: open specifications that pSeries systems (and Motorola systems) have complied with in the past. AIX only runs on systems that comply with them. ah Apple hardware and almost all PowerPC emulators are a mix of both, and some extras. the instruction set architecture for the power stuff no er, architecture specifications... no? basically. it states that OpenBoot is required, PowerPC, amongst other things. ok, so a higher level system/platform specification? POWER and PowerPC have very little instructional differences. there's no need for separate specifications. peerce: yes. i assume AIX has some sort of licensing enforcement in it so it will only run on authorized platforms? not really dealt with that yet. I doubt it. AIX (depending on the version) should run on any system that is CHRP or PReP-compliant. it ran on a lot of older PowerPC hardware from Motorola, and the Apple Network Server awww, man. this crank-powered rechargable LED flashlight has a bad battery so it won't hold a charge for more than a few mins.

"hi Is it possible to delay packages for x ms using iptables? hmmm, not sure. Interesting idea, though. I think there are some targets which can have a similar effect. I've never played with them. ok :) Hi. I am trying to setup a linux box with 2 internet connections but I can't get it to work. I keep getting ""Network is unreachable"" when using ip route add default via. does anybody know what I could be doing wrong? omarc55: <a href=""http://www.ssi.bg/~ja/#routes"">http://www.ssi.bg/~ja/#routes</a> (requires patched kernel, patch is here) version 2.6.9-1.667smp requires this patch? thats odd since this was working before (with an old connection) now they got a new connection and it doesn't want to work. <a href=""http://www.ssi.bg/~ja/#routes-2.6"">http://www.ssi.bg/~ja/#routes-2.6</a> oh I guess it depands how you want to use it. If you only want one default gateway and the other one merely reply to connections received, you don't need the patch. yeah. what I was doing was, having both connections running. all tcp traffic would go through eth1 and all udp traffic through eth2 and I can't get that to work, I am stuck on that command. and I know the device is up, I checked with ifconfig. and I can ping the gateway. Hmmm, I would think with a protocol split like that you'd have to use -t mangle -j MARK and ip rule ... fwmark. (I've never tried that.) yeah, thats what I was doing. but do you know why I could be getting that error? ""ip route list ; ip rule list"" might have some ideas.",0
"channel #whatwg is 'WHATWG (HTML5) -- http://www.whatwg.org/ -- Logs: http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/ -- Please leave your sense of logic at the door, thanks!' by annevk on Thu Feb 05 13:51:18 5b1b00790db5a105e7d3f795b45b10a1: The actual parsing of entities we can't really change (because of need for compat. with existing content), what we can change is what is conforming, and making & legal on its own gets fairly complex. a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554, the format of entities is that above today e.g. &copy= does turn into Â¬Â©= 5b1b00790db5a105e7d3f795b45b10a1: It isn't. Things like &copy do parse like that, and need to for compatibility, even though they are non-conforming. a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554, not every non-conforming change should be supported 5b1b00790db5a105e7d3f795b45b10a1: Browser vendors will not make changes to parsing that breaks existing content. (And that is absolutely non-negotiable: if the spec changes to something incompatible, we'll just break the spec) a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554, does that mean <b> foo <i> bar </i> baz </b> is part of HTML5 ops I mean b i b i 5b1b00790db5a105e7d3f795b45b10a1: It has a defined parse tree. It is non-conforming. 5b1b00790db5a105e7d3f795b45b10a1: Any character stream has a defined parse tree. So is that valid HTML5? 5b1b00790db5a105e7d3f795b45b10a1: No, it is non-conforming. a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554, but &copy= is? 5b1b00790db5a105e7d3f795b45b10a1: No, that is non-conforming too. I see. So HTML5 defines the exact behavior of non-conforming code. Yes. And & as a literal is supported, but non-conforming. For example: M & M 5b1b00790db5a105e7d3f795b45b10a1: That is legal because a whitespace character follows it I see. Thanks for the info, guys 5b1b00790db5a105e7d3f795b45b10a1: The only place you're allowed a & followed by anything within script and style a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554, sure those are defined as literal blocks terminated by strictly </script> and </style> I suppose this is their de-facto behavior. Yeah nice (case insensitively) oh yea I gotta check how html5 deals with textarea ;) entities are supported.. but nothing else :) curious one is kinda running around, but can probably answer most of these questions :)",0

"i have been digging through the iptables docs at netfilter.org but I still didnt manage to find a solution for following question if I want to filter out reserved addresses and my box has two network cards (eth0 for outside and eth1 to inside)... will I have to set drop rules on both INPUT and FORWARD chains ? couldnt I just use for example some PREROUTING chain and set the drops in there ? Apachez: you could use PREROUTING any disadvantage with that ? I also have -i so Im checking that the package is originated from the outside device not that I know of. the netfilter guys say it ""shouldn't"" be done, but if you ask em why, it's because then it'll filter in both INPUT and FORWARD, but of course that's exactly what you want will I have to use -t nat -A PREROUTING or can write just -A PREROUTING ? good question. I dunno if the filter table (the default table) has a PREROUTING chain. try and see. hmpf :P another note since I altered my iptables rules to be strict and also check sourceport = 1024:65535 I have noticed some logs where some addresses try to ask my dns but they originate from sourceport 53 I never-ever-ever match on source port. shouldnt a dns lookup originate from sourceport 1024:65535 ? not necessarily a tcp request can pretty much originate from any port it wants not according to rfc's :P well what they SHOULD do and what they can get away with doing, which is more like what they'll do in real life, are different thats why I use a firewall :P if machines and people just did what they SHOULD do they would be no need for firewalls ;) <a href=""http://iownmymusic.org/"">http://iownmymusic.org/</a> <a href=""http://iownmydvds.org/"">http://iownmydvds.org/</a> ."") ohh finally my google skills are working well there are actually security benefits for you if you can randomize the source ports of your tcp connections, and things will still work fine unless there are source-port-filtering firewalls on the other end seems like the case when a new connection to destport 53 originates from sourceport 53 it is most likely a hack attempt to try to bypass stateless firewalls also iptables-tutorial.frozentux.net has WAY better docs (IMHO) than netfilter.org yup will try to read them through state has nothing to do with it I have a stateful firewall that doesn't care at all about source ports I'm concerned about where the packet wants to go, not so much where it came from well its more of a sanity check like pf's ""scrub in all"" which I saw existed like a module in iptables until kernel 2.6 where it was being removed by some odd reasons well, that's why you're seeing possibly-legitimate dns traffic bouncing off your firewall it was from south korea so I doubt it was even near legitimate traffic :P personally, I'd rather let a few illegitimate packets through than drop anything that ought to get through. that preference probably comes from my belief that if you follow security best practices behind your firewall, a firewall doesn't really do much for you anyway. well thats not the case in here where I need to enforce strict policies when dealing with custom chains... is it necessary to use -j RETURN in the end of the chain ? or is that part added automagically by iptables ? Apachez: correct, custom chains will return to the caller if a rule is not matched oki then I wont need it in the end of each custom rule :) no, just at the end of the chain - and maybe not even then. depends on what you're doing in that chain. ehm here is my example <a href=""http://www.sqlpaste.com/?entry_id=1417"">http://www.sqlpaste.com/?entry_id=1417</a> Will I need an explicit ""iptables -A BLACKLIST -j RETURN"" in the end of the BLACKLIST chain ? or is it just best practise to always have one in the end ? is it possible to use --dport or --sport alone without -p tcp or -p udp ? Apachez: no. if you don't specify a protocol, it assumes 'all', and not all protocols have ports.",0

Its to me useless people are dieing to embed Flash player to just have protocol which they can do with Html5 or html6 ? cccf6e8df69ab2a10aa10762ad03b67e: join #whatwg channel. that's the spec working group. cccf6e8df69ab2a10aa10762ad03b67e: they have also mailing lists and probably have a process for accepting proposals cool 0acb83f1a9cfc48f061ff5555e61c6bf thanks",0

"I implemented the text/html content sniffing algorithm in JavaScript http://html5.lachy.id.au/content-sniffing/ also checked it into google code f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: should the [invalid] sequence '<??>' really be text/html? that's what the algorithm says in the spec I wondered about that too, but I figured it would be better to implement exactly what the spec says and then provide feedback about it wait, why wouldn't <??> be text/html? if anything, it should always be text/html, since it's not well formed XML and thus can't be a feed i.e. <??><feed> probably shouldn't be Atom f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: that's a good environment to run testcases for browsers yep it would probably be a good idea to integrate it into the live dom viewer later similar to http://html5.org/parsing-tests/testrunner.htm and http://simon.html5.org/test/html/serializing/001.htm though you could use json as the format for the tests right, that shouldn't be too hard to do though i wonder if you have to have a server involved to actually test what browsers do i.e. the relevant sniffing only occurs for resources served over the wire yeah, but that's not too hard to do true I tried a few simple test cases with data: URIs and Firefox didn't sniff them right, data: are never sniffed afaik so we'd probably need to load from the server into an iframe or something exactly slightly annoying but certainly doable :) I think I have a PHP script somewhere that will echo whatever data you pass, using whatever MIME specified, we could perhaps also use ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c's appoach with creating tests hmm might be better to just find all the edge cases http://canvex.lazyilluminati.com/misc/dom-viewer/reflect.cgi?%3Cscript%3Ealert('Hello%20world')%3C/script%3E echoes stuff but it's probably not so useful since it always does text/html (There's a reflect-xhtml.cgi for XHTML) I've got one that does the same thing, though I'm going to make it check for a content-type parameter in the query string and use that http://canvex.lazyilluminati.com/misc/dom-viewer/reflect.c - I don't really fancy modifying that to actually parse the query string at all, so it's probably more sensible to use PHP :-) the only problem with something like that is that it creates a huge security risk f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: the spec doesn't define text/plain when it lacks angle brackets? virtuelv, no, why would it? goes back and reads the proposal again c3fb53c6c6b7a0afb097cd0b6f6d06aa, it's the algorithm that sniffs content delivered as text/html to see if it's a feed.

I'll have to add stripslashes for now, since I can't remember how to do it in .htaccess or php.ini or whatever it is i can't get ""<rss>"" to be echoed in firefox and safari no wait it works in safari f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: you also need an id on the <datalist> :) oops :-) where can I find an Atom test file? in the rfc :) never mind, found one hmm, ie doesn't add attributes to the root node from misplaced <html> tags it appears that Firefox will only sniff as the result of a GET request, not a POST Firefox needs to see the Atom xmlns and there needs to be at least a title and link element in it for it to be sniffed as a feed. http://html5.lachy.id.au/output?type=text%2Fhtml&data=%3Cfeed+xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2005%2FAtom%22%3E%0D%0A++%3Ctitle%3EExample+Feed%3C%2Ftitle%3E%0D%0A++%3Clink+href%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fexample.org%2F%22%2F%3E%0D%0A%3C%2Ffeed%3E%0D%0A doesn't opera sniff for feeds? it doesn't appear to maybe it needs more content in it nope, it doesn't (at least not for Atom) not for rss 2.0 either hmm. How do I turn off AddDefaultCharset for just that one file? I've tried putting it in a <Files> directive, but it doesn't seem to to work AddDefaultCharset Off in the same folder should work (for all files in that folder) yeah, but it's in the root directory, so I don't want it to do that dunno perhaps opera only does sniffing for following <link>s oh well, I'll just turn it off for everything now and fix it later maybe, try it but it's a php file, and AddDefaultCharset doesn't apply to php php sends its own headers http://html5.lachy.id.au/output?type=text%2Fhtml&data=%3Clink+rel%3D%22alternate%22+type%3D%22application%2Fatom%2Bxml%22+href%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fhtml5.lachy.id.au%2Foutput%3Ftype%3Dtext%252Fhtml%26data%3D%253Cfeed%2Bxmlns%253D%2522http%253A%252F%252Fwww.w3.org%252F2005%252FAtom%2522%253E%250D%250A%2B%2B%253Ctitle%253EExample%2BFeed%253C%252Ftitle%253E%250D%250A%2B%2B%253Clink%2Bhref%253D%2522http% 253A%252F%252Fexample.org%252F%2522%252F%253E%250D%250A%253C%252Ffeed%253E%250D%250A%22%3E%0D%0A%3Cp%3ETest AddDefaultCharset applies based on the MIME type I think so all text/* responses get ; charset=... yeah but php will still send its own headers php overrides apache indeed, but it's not. I'm using headers(""Content-Type: $type""); in the php, so it should send exactly what's in the text box, but it doesn't it does afaict yeah, it does now, cause I turned off AddDefaultCharset already but if I turn it on again, it won't can you turn it on again, please? done oh, indeed. that's not how my server behaves though perhaps a different version of php or different settings which version of Apache does your server run? 1.3 iirc I'm using PHP 5, Apache 1.3 I think php 4 ok, so then php 5 pays attention to apache settings I'll try it with PHP4... hmm, perhaps i was wrong nope, still does it I've turn default charset off again cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0, for the HTML status updating, I think it would be easiest if we just use HTTP basic authentication and using a .htpasswd file, which grants access to the confirmation script for Hixie (or whoever else is authorised) f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: ok we just need to write the script that commits the changes to the DB, and then make a few minor changes to the existing update script and we're done f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: great f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: it's all the magic_quotes settings a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554, thanks, I do have the instructions for it written down somewhere. I just have to find them and set it up http://uk2.php.net/magic_quotes (a ""feature"" that's gone in PHP6) interpreter/compiler-level settings that change programming language semantics suck big time yeah, PHP already sucks and fixing PHP by turning off silly ""features"" just needs to be done according to the PHP devs, <span title=""this > that""> is invalid HTML. the only way I could get them to fix the bug in strip_tags() which claims to only work with valid HTML anyway was to quote both HTML5, HTML 4.01, and SGML. PHP devs often don't know HTML very well at all try to get them to fix the ampersand bug, for instance! the one where they generate and output ""...&PHPSESSID=..."" instead of using &amp; Or just get them to handle multiple selects/checkboxes without hacking the names yeah, that too Although that's not html-specific, they mangle it the same way with parsing ini files f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: oh, that's a config option. duh :P a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554, I know, but it should be default! but backwards compatibility!11!!!!elevnty! they should have fixed it for PHP5, which isn't backwards compatible anyway or even PHP6 yes, they're backwards compatible!11!!1! It's stupid. They refuse to fix things in the name of BC, yet totally break it anyway. yeah, I know. I should just learn python and how to get it running on my server yeah, I've been meaning to learn python too. far more general use, too Python's going to break backward compatibility too, but at least they're intending to fix lots of small mistakes at the same time, which seems good as long as you only do it once a decade woo hoo!

"3b630800966be5c4f7eb283c363eb7f4, do you have an opinion on this? http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=14253 looks 88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762: this is about allowing execCommand to take cm, mm, pt, etc...? 3b630800966be5c4f7eb283c363eb7f4, I'm suggesting a new command, maybe fontSizePt. fontSize takes legacy sizes 1-7, which isn't what users expect from WYSIWYG editors. oh I see mn... adding new command for each new unit seems inelegant I suggest a command that accepts pt, since that's what editors normally use. All the other absolute units are defined as a multiple of pt. mn... So I think it would be okay to just have one for pt. We could allow input in other absolute units, like px or mm. oh I see what you're saying that allowing it to be more precise in pt? So execCommand('fontSizePt', false, '12') might be the same as execCommand('fontSizePt', false, '12pt'), but you could also do execCommand('fontSizePt', false, '16px'). Yes. right okay I think that makes sense However, queryCommandValue() would always have to return pt. right Since it has to return some specific unit, and pt makes the most sense for WYSIWYG. although it'll be nice if it were configurable Although getComputedStyle returns px. but then... people can always get px value out of getComputedStyle How could it be configurable? add some command like FontSizeWithPx just like styleWithCSS but kind of ugly to introduce those states too though anyway lunch time for now. I don't like commands like that, because they're global. It will make other code do something unexpected. will be back ~hour Okay. 88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762: yeah, not too nice",0

Hmmm have another suggestion? Well, the other thing I'd like a direct link to would be the test itself Not sure how to balance those two things click on the source file I do think the search parameters should be a query string, in general, though. They're name-value pairs. (actually the plan is to have a tab interface with a view of the test in the same page) ah replacing the history view having the search param as path components keeps the URLs search engine friendly fwiw 3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d: btw, nice work on the hg docs. I'm doing another pass now... Wouldn't it make more sense for the search engine to treat http://test.csswg.org/shepherd/testcase/height-width-table-001/name/height-width-table-001/ and http://test.csswg.org/shepherd/testcase/height-width-table-001/ as the same thing? small re-org and adding conflict resolution possibly ? (^^ to the hg docs) I think the only thing that's missing is an example of what hg says when there's a conflict working on that now and what a conflicted doc looks like so you can find and fix it cool re the search params, it's all actually params under the hood, so switching between paths and query strings is a config option... I'll play with it a bit as Shepherd matures k, so I would suggest to let the search results listing be a path, and the test's search params (which are really only there to keep track of your next/previous links) to be query string... is that reasonable? because the report on a single testcase should always have the same URL, and be recognizeable to the search engine as the same page I have to give it some thought... but not unreasonable I want to evolve the functionality a bit and figure out all the possible states before making a final call there k just something to keep in mind then sure as I said, that's all configurable",0

"Hi Hi so what's up The cake is a...? the cake? what are you talking about? Has the world gone mad? No, so then what? ""The cake is a lie"" is a quote from a popular computer game why would i know that? I was testing to see if you were a teenage boy. well i'm not, whether or not i passed the test Which you obvioulsy aren't. or i could be a normal teenage boy who'd rather play sports than games Are you born in March? (or in the spring) Yes, but then he would have heard about it from friends. noooo not always true. my friends could play baseball too Most it most likely to be. :) or sports in general and it's not most likely Yes, it is. :) Silly girl. not really ^^ I know. all my friends are guys, i think i'd know And they play sports I take it. yes. baseball, basketball, wrestling, boxing, you name it, i bet one plays it Then you are born summer time? noooo No? :O Then when? no december And what's your favorite color? red That's what I thought. sure you did Dog person? no i hate animals Why? Or is that what your typing now.. they're just irritating. i prefer humans. not as pets. just in general I get that! yup I hate dogs. i hate all pets They're irritating. i prefer cats. i hate cats too Do you count tigers as pets? i can't stand any feline wolves? sure. elephants? sure. but any feline? no way sure yup Well, are you into music? yeah Then I've got something for you! If you want to.. www.myspace.com/dennisfyhr But probably won't like it. But you* I like most music, but i don't wanna open a new link in my brower so maybe i'll look at it later Okay :) Music is the best. Way better than animals. sure i prefer human contact Are you american? yeah Did you mean human physical contact? why? no. i just would prefer to talk to people than listen to music nothing physical Just trying get a feel of what different people from different countries are like. where are you from? Do you believe in evolution? no Sweden. i'm swedish! VÃ¤nta lite! i'm not that swedish. i'm a second generation american. i don't understand swedish PÃ¥ riktigt? (For real?) but yes, i really am Oh, okay sure But about evolution, why don't you believe in it? i'm lutheran. i believe in god But that has (almost) nothing to do with evolution! Evolution doesn't contradict God. yes it does. god created man he didn't create fish, who turned into man And you really believe that? yes No, I know he didn't create fish! That's just silly! i don't really want to talk about religion if that's ok Wait! I just remembered why I brought it up. why? I wanted to try to explain evolution to an american in a way that they would understand it better. But I won't if you don't want me to. i don't really. i don't like discussing things like religion and politics Okay, the things that make america suck more than it has to. Which state are you from? :) oh thanks a lot. i feel great about you saying that about my country ^^ It's so easy! what is? insulting me? No, I don't know.. :/ I made it sound like I did. But I didn't. Sorry. sure It's actually 4 am here, and if you don't want me to help you progress as a person I feel more like going to sleep. :P How about DNA? you're still insulting me. i'd rather sleep too than be insulted. you're kind of a jerk with the comments you make first you insult me as an american, then you insult me, saying i'm of low intellect Last insult (sorry!): It's hard not to insult americans, when trying to help them develop. Because first you have to let them know what they're doing wrong, and that's when it's like saying, 'God, you're stupid!'. And then they don't wanna listen anymore. And that's the story of how americans stay behind. Yes. Good night. :)",0

"It says something that when I see a Java plugin used I'm actively surprised, whereas a decade ago it wouldn't have surprised me in the least (though annoyed me while I waited for the JVM to startupâÃÂ¶) want jvm in browser by default instead js. If somebody wants js - Rhino f69d55844584e567962289a5226442b4: I want something where a single company doesn't control the language by virtue of holding patents over it. mm. patents. ok. llvm f69d55844584e567962289a5226442b4: Too slow, and not designed for non-trusted code-execution. but monopoly is ok. single version. single mind. better than 3-4 companies implements same stuff i.e. just waste haman resources (slow in the compile-time sense, not in generated-code performance) f69d55844584e567962289a5226442b4: Then why have multiple browser engines at all? What incentive is there for performance, etc? lets c++ compler maker fights, not we :) and cpu manufacturers But that doesn't really affect the performance of canvas that much. but ok. monopoly is ideal. you want stimul to make product better. i see MS make Windows better w/o pressure of concurents. thay just cares about users oracle too that ill called perfectionism f69d55844584e567962289a5226442b4: MS don't make Windows better for that reason, MS continue to develop Windows because licensing is tied to specific Windows versions. To continue to sell site-licenses, they have to invalidate the old licenses. The revenue they get from per-unit OEM sales is comparitively minute. f69d55844584e567962289a5226442b4: A good monopoly example where you have no financial incentive to develop it further is IE/Win, and the abandonment of its development a decade ago. It brings in no revenue to MS, so it's purely a cost-sink. a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 for example we have Flash. wa have canvas. Flash api much better and faster than canvas because Adobe is monopoly. single version. but 3 companies enchange canvas speed triple slower. And after 5+ years canvas reach level of flash f69d55844584e567962289a5226442b4: It's not clear simply having more resources working on a single engine would have addressed that problem any quicker. a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 because IE6 was ideal. 3d, vector graphic, FFI(activex), sound, video, smil, etc f69d55844584e567962289a5226442b4: The IE team didn't, and were fully intending on fixing bugs in the near future after IE6. They were intending on fixing places where hasLayout became black-box observable, expecting to continue on the same fairly quick release-cycle IE had had at that point. (Fairly quick at least compared with IE today)",0

"anyone use the chrome page speed? nope yslow? yup well, at least if it seemed to work with Aurora hello everyone i need help with HTML5 boxes does anybody in here? i am trying to move up the left lower box - http://joomlademos.co.uk/bar/# so i won't have this huge white space below you may want a column layout, then, because right now it's lined up with the box to the right of it, due to ""?Ã«?Â® ?Ã®?â¢?Ã?â ?Ã¯?â¢ ?â¢?Ã?Â©?Ã¯?Â®?â¢""'s size pomax i dont get you how do I do column layout? you're now using a horizontal layout, so the first section and aside are on ""line"" 1, and the second section and aside are on line *""line"" 2 you can move the aside up if you really want, by setting ""position: relative; top: -2em;"" or some other value that works for this specific page, but it'll be a kind of manual hack ok and there is another solution? how do i change to column instead of ""lines"" it depends a little on what you want, design wise. do you want the asides and sections lined up, or do you want the sections and asides to independently fill up the vertical space? i want the asides 50% 50% and the sections 60% 40% is it possible without ""hacks""? it is, then you need to group the things that sum up to 100% i've tried so you get something like <div id=""asides""><aside>...</aside><aside>...</aside></div> and another <div id=""sections""><section>...</section><section>...</section></div> -- if your content is always going to be two asides and two sections, then that's a perfectly valid structure, which you can CSS style fairly simple i'll try with the DIVS should i use floating? http://jsfiddle.net/dWzES/ well, thanks a lot, is that matters whether aside comes first or section? i am floating to right becasue it's RTL not really, you can change the order (I forgot to set RTL for this fiddle) ok thank you by the way, did you see my image slide? i know it is possible to make this one with html5, do you know any understandable reference i can learn how to make this images circulator on html5? right know it works with AJAX I would just keep using one of the many, many image slider JS things out there. do you know any straightforward image slider like this one? without buttons, just fading not off hand, but there's probably twenty jquery plugins that will do the trick for you",0

"waves waves Hi 245a58a5dc42397caf57bc06c2c0afd2! thanks for joining this channel I wanted to learn about REC rescinding Some members of WebApps proposed Rescinding the DOM 2 Views REC -> http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/tr.html#rec-rescind Ok http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Views/ summary: - group requests rescind - director evaluates request and starts 4-week review - outcome determines yes or no and if ""yes"" we update the latest version URI to point to a thing that says ""RESCINDED!"" So the main effort is making the case why to rescind So the main effort is making the case why to rescind only typed one sentence while Art was away may have missed some stuff ;-( nope Yes, I think the ProcDoc is clear we need some rationale we don't have the rationale in ""the separate doc"" and I haven't issued a CfC to determine the WG's position Have any RECs ever been rescinded? No. The PD seems like the bar is quite low which can be good OTOH, it seems like the rationale should be quite compelling e.g. a REC includes a massive security hole For older specs it's not as relevant, but for newer ones you lose patent commitments http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/#sec-Requirements ""10. If the Recommendation is rescinded by W3C, then no new licenses need be granted but any licenses granted before the Recommendation was rescinded shall remain in effect."" (to be clear: no new ones required...but the question is whether people actually got licenses...) That seems reasonable What actually happens to a REC that is rescinded? Is it updated directly? I expect that we would update the status section in place And the LV URI would point to a stub that gives rationale So, it sounds like the next step is to get WG consenus yes and then ask the broader community like www-dom and perhaps chairs the way we ask the broader community is the 4-week review period and if there are no objections, then go the AC? The 4-week review is public + AC so you can build support before the 4-week review if you want or just use the 4-week review to make the case to everyone. how do you actually do the Public review? We haven't done this before but I would think: - email on group's mailing list - home page news calling for review - chairs - ac - anyone else known to be importnat (or likely to be affected) I think the funky part here is that some non-member may normatively reference the REC and they don't see the announcement but I guess that is unavoidable We might want to make an effort to tell the IETF I wonder if the JCP f.ex. ever did something with DOM 2 View and other parties you think may care You could take some time before the request to the director to start raising awareness and then the 4-week review is when people send comments We can always blame Arnaud ;-) Yes, that's quite useful. I need to step away for a call...but I can be on irc for more questions yes, there are certainly some things to do before the formal 4-week review begins Thanks 245a58a5dc42397caf57bc06c2c0afd2! good luck! 8b3687499080633e1898fa1dd209ef81 - do you think you and Anne could put together the rationale doc? In practice, I think that just means a paragraph or two in WebApps' wiki space. I guess now that's passion! I'm prepared to be stunned and inspired by the rationale ""This sucks"" A word or two, you said? :) I think there is some pain to gain calculus that should be done Say what? I think it makes sense to calculate the pain to gain ratio before proceeding Mm e.g. what's the worst case scenario if D2V REC is _not_ rescinded or IOW, if it isn't rescinded, will anyone notice?",0

"Yo, I'm a humble webdesigner and I was reading wikipedia when I got ""see also-ed"" WHATWG. I'm a litte confused as to why theres a XHTML 2 and a HTML5 I thought XHTML replaced HTML as like a new version. d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88: http://blog.whatwg.org/faq/ might help (although it doesn't really cover in detail what you're asking about yet :( ...) d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88: xhtml was never really meant to replace html; it's a common misconception :( maybe here http://xhtml.com/en/future/conversation-with-x-html-5-team/ are some basic principles described d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88: but in any case, html5 has an xml serialization as well should you want to use it (referred to as xhtml5) ic.. well I don't really use any xml thank you for the links. ok. then presumably the xml serialization is less interesting to you than the text/html serialization hmm.. I really need to learn about this stuff. Does the w3c decide what can and cant be used for web development? d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88: does the w3c endorce flash? s/endorce/endorse/ ah yeah so, what do they do exactly? just provide nice buttons for your websites? no ""w3c"" is mostly a name aiui. then there are many working groups working on different things e.g. a new html wg was chartered recently to work on the same thing that the whatwg are working on, basically http://www.w3.org/html/wg/ so two seperate groups are working on the same thing? it hasn't been decided formally yet what the htmlwg will be doing, but taking the whatwg proposals as a starting point is the only real proposal that has been put forward though the charter is very similar to the whatwg proposals, so presumably that is the intent ah ic. so if the whatwg proposal is accepted will they begin working with them? yes hopefully it will be one and the same spec with the same editors that are part of both groups (i and many others here are members of both groups) so whats this for http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/ d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88: the xhtml2 wg's home page yeah but why is there a xhtml2 and a (x)html5 d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88: because the people in the xhtml2 wg (the old html wg) had a different vision of the future of the web than the vision of opera, mozilla and apple So does that mean xhtml2 will never be implemented into a browser? well, aiui opera, mozilla and apple are not interested in implementing xhtml2 microsoft have bigger fish to fry what do you mean by that? whats microsoft up to? microsoft are chairing the html wg, but i don't know what their plans are wrt xhtml2 (i would presume they won't implement xhtml2 anytime soon) (or at all) I've never gotten anything to work with IE anyway. I signed upto the forums. its a bit of a ghost town. I would of thought it would be full of web developers the forums are not so old but feel free to ask questions there ah Ic. whats with the skinny author column in viewtopic um. dunno. probably because it's not in quirks mode And no avatars! you want avatars? yeah, it so much easier to remember somebody with an image rather than there name. It should be just the quality of the message that is important, not who wrote it ;-) anyone here against avatars? yeah but if someone has written several quality messages you are more inclined to listen to their opinion thinks they do make it easier to follow a discussion enabled (It's like in IRC when there's a discussion between people whose names are the same length, and you can't tell who's who without actually reading all the letters, which is irritating) ok.. now to find/make an avatar oh my god... I've always questioned that trailing slash Some clients assign random colors to each nick to separate them, but it might get too intense X-Chat Aqua does that yo... this may be a stupid question but in html5 if you just wrote <div> and didn't have a </div> anywhere would it treat it as a void div.. or would it just not work It would work the same as in current HTML (The whole parsing algorithm is designed to be compatible with what browsers currently implement) Is it a bad thing to have an empty div? because sometimes (actually quite alot) I use divs purely for presentational purposes an empty div for presentational purposes is mostly harmless mostly...? but using html for presentational purposes in general is not what html is designed to do (...but a <div> without a matching </div> is an error and makes the document non-conforming, regardless of how it's parsed) so can you write it as ""<div>"" or does it have to be ""<div></div>"" the latter why? if theres nothing in it why does it need the </div> because otherwise everything after it will be children of the div e.g. compare ""<div>X"" with ""<div></div>X"" oh ok, it just looks a little silly is all do you gentlemen mind if I show off my latest design to you? its written in xhtml tho.. with the <br />s so I hope none get offended I think the people here don't mind much about impure language usage - that's why we're not working on XHTML :-) its um still a work in progress http://www.michaelmh.com/stuff/JimKing/ its a bit iffy in opera with the drop down color change bit. and it basically explodes in IE. should be fine in Firefox and Safari i'm a newbie to javascript and php tho so the color change thing might be a bit iffy too who picked pink? looks innocent do you like whole one area controlled by the page scroll bar thing going on? purple... fails to break the code :-( what did you do? I was scared of someone breaking it. it validates both client side and server side Maybe it'd be nice if that area could expand to fill the screen, since it's otherwise fairly tiny in the middle of a big screen - I have no idea how to implement that, though (It also breaks really badly in Firefox 3 when scrolling, since everything jumps around until it's redrawn the whole screen, but maybe they'll fix that eventually) Otherwise I think it looks good, particularly with the faint shadows :-) :D thanks. I'm really chuffed with the code too. I literally just started learning javascript two days ago (and consequently php since I need to validate the info client side and write it to a file.) and i coded the bit which checks the brightness of the colour. I nicked the thing that checks whether or not the value is hex tho, I couldnt fiqure out how to do that well gtg. I'll come back on tommoro with new questions once I've read all this stuff. nice shade of blue ;)",0
"hsivonen, I might check it out. Thanks 8f941f02ec22ed2bac655f0e52b1395c, didn't want to put you off 8f941f02ec22ed2bac655f0e52b1395c, it basically means that browsers are crazy pieces of software full of holes and the web somehow still works great edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e, nah, I see your point :) 8f941f02ec22ed2bac655f0e52b1395c, and that you typically should not approach what browsers do rationally I am becomig increasingly convinced that the criteria for success of technology we find intuitive are not quite correct. I have wondered about that too it seems a certain amount of imperfection does great for adoption HTML and PHP being nice examples of that It is. The users are needy: they always go out of scope in order to stretch a spec to fill new needs. Users are imperfect: they make mistakes. And users do not care about ideals: they have a specific line and they draw a straight line from their need to the closest approximation of a solution. specific need*",0

"the specialness of lang&xml:lang continues to result in insane amounts of code... :-( more code than prose? 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: more code 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: in the Java version of the parser, I want to have a non-browser sanity mode that magically turns lang on HTML elements to xml:lang in the infoset 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: but in the C++ version, I don't want to pay the memory footprint that the feature would take if latent (and in the Java version not paying for it as RAM footprint would make the code slower) on top of that, there are all sorts of checks on the validation layer morning laddies different ones for HTML and XHTML sounds like a pain i recommend not supporting xhtml. :-D (only kidding) If I could go back in time, I'd ask the definers of XML get rid of the xml: stuff and to grandfather lang and id. (and zap xml:space) you'd be ignored like everyone who _did_ ask them to doso at least I had the foresight to arrange my data structures so that I can just clip my arrays by one element when generating the C++ version I wonder what would break if we defined lang in HTML to become an attribute whose local name and qualified name are ""lang"" but the namespace is the XML namespace on HTML nodes, that is not on SVG and MathML nodes getAttribute('lang'), for one, if i understand you right also you'd still have a syntax issue, except now lang="""" in HTML would be equal to xml:lang="""" in XML and lang="""" in XML and xml:lang="""" in HTML would both be null-namespace attributes with no semantics, leading to no end of extra confusion 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: why? it matches on qualified name, which would be ""lang"" i thought it matches on name + namespace=null IIRC, no so how are clashes resolved? oh, qname man that would be so confusing 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: however, it would break setAttribute(""lang"", 'en') unless setAttribute were made magic i don't care about lang enough to do this :-) well, in general, namespaces result in an insane amount of code that doesn't do anything useful but has to be there for correctness and compat yes",0

"Does vim7 support unicode in windows? vim supports unicode for ages. are you sure? I run gvim in windows, but when I try to write Hebrew, it shows ???? (questions marks). I use utf8 encoded files for at least 3 years with vim. That's a font thing. You might be missing the right font for it. Doesn't the default font support unicode? UTF-8 works fine in vim in my linux box though It should be the same font You expect Windows and Linux to have the same default fonts? Doesn't vim install its own fonts? Not that I am aware of. deryni, How can I switch to RTL? I don't use gvim, is it in the menus somewhere? I use vim -H when I need to do that (which isn't often). deryni, the linux vim edition automatically switches to RTL when typing in Arabic or Hebrew. Not the windows version though The gvim you mean? let me try vim in windows And mine doesn't seem to switch anything when I switch keymaps. vim in windows doesn't support utf-8 at all I don't really believe that. because the command-prompt doesn't support utf-8 Console vim you mean, and I suppose that might be possible. yep deryni, There is one problem: is it possible to combine English with Arabic in the same file? if I try echo ""...""; Hm? and write between those quotations some arabic word, it is typed LTR The letters are reversed. I don't know how well/if vim handles mixed ltr/rtl text. Can I do something like s[-1] to get the last character of a string?",0

J4k3, is dhclient3 buggy ? DrDT, No idea. |lostbyte|: then ask the admin |lostbyte|: I haven't heard of problems with dhclient DrDT, how do i find ? or is there another dhcp-client i can use to test. |lostbyte|: maybe that the DHCP server is crappy/wierd (lol MS) and wants some kind of windows-specific flag. Again, ask the admin what DHCP server it is and then you can google DrDT, k.. offer oral sex if necessary haa. yeah, like that, except open wider dame, he is out of town. DrDT, Could i read more about dhcp request flags and where ? |lostbyte|: I don't know if ""flags"" in the right word for DHCP packet options. I don't even know if this is your problem. frankly, this is impossible to solve without knowing the software at both ends. it could be that your DHCP server doesn't want to re-give an IP to your MAC address unless your MAC address asks to renew the IP it was given before (for which you would need to be in the same OS) Boo. meh no.",0

"how do you set the margin of a widget placed onto a layout? dust: type ""margin"" into the assistant index and you'll see QLayout::setMargin() there i am using the designer, i changed the layout margin properties of the parent window, but this seems not to change anything but let me have a look at the source the designer produces ok fixing the code manually helped, thanks blockd odd, you should be able to do it in designer too. You might want to use the object inspector to select the layout (if you're having trouble getting it) getting the right one that is probably thats the reason object inspector, good to know hmmm would you use a QTextBrowser object as a replacement for plain console output? how would you reroute console output to that window? it would be nice if you could just reroute the cout stream I dup you can do it dup = doubt? hm maybe just collect the output in a stream and append it to the window manually /dev/audio; sudo cat /dev/urandom > /dev/mem #whatever floats your boat"") I was being silly, but if it's from your app (not a QProcess) maybe just use qInstallMsgHandler if that's sufficient but there is a dup and dup2 on unix ;) how can i add a QGLWidget in the designer? the designer does not seem to support this type of widget Bye everyone!!! :)",0

I don't know why, but it's seasonal and situational... I'm pretty sure.

"So, hey, does anyone know of any examples of video on the web that are *not* done through <video> or plugins? I don't know if this actually exists or not. And more specifically, if it *does* exist, does it act like <video> with respect to letter-boxing when the container isn't the right size? Or does it try and fully scale itself like an image would? You mean native browser support for videos? I guess. Not sure. Hakon says there is some. I doubt this. It's the point upon which our argument was hinging on today in the conf call. There's animated GIFs Maybe also http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms533606(VS.85).aspx They resize like images, right? has several animated gifs on hand, and can check. I don't know what else exists that isn't <embed>/<object>, though 1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb: Yes, they're just the same as any image (at least when you use them in <img>) Yeah. Ah, nobody cares about HTML+TIME. Seems strange to hinge an argument on the behaviour of clearly obscure technologies where you don't even know if they exist :-) Well, if they *do* exist, we have to add a new value that means ""do whatever is appropriate for the media"". If they don't, then the existing ones are fine. Why do we have to do what they do? <video> will fail to support a load of things that people do already (When you say ""plugins"", do you just mean Flash, or do you also mean to exclude things like WMP/QuickTime/RealPlayer plugins that were used before Flash video came along?) Anything that would invoke the plugin architecture. Also, sorry, was referring to a CSS discussion, not HTML. Specifically, the image-fit property, which determines how replaced content scales in its content box. So, those other things you mentioned count as plugins. Oh Hm. I need to eat a distinctly Texan lunch today, since it will be one of my last few before I move. Wonder where I should go? I suggest going to Texas Step 1: Done. Sounds like you're well on the way to having a genuine Texan lunch, then I also need to finally go buy myself a cowboy hat tonight, since it is a conspicuous lack in my life. Gotta play up the ""y'all"" and ""ma'am"" when I move.",0

"debian sid out there? hey hali Oracle instance in a RAC setup with 2 sun cluster nodes ... when I reboot one node, the instance on the other node also died. It'd come back after the other node comes back. direct links between the servers without switches for the interconnect? anything in the cssd log? yes, direct links for interconnects , no transport juntions thats a problem no wait... why is that a problem ? since the remaining node will detect a network failure cable problem link lost ... in dmesg? let me check you should have more exact errors in the cssd and crs logs is oracle on xp just total garbage (assuming xp's fault)? this stupid thing just will not stay up it's ment to be ""usable"" hmm...weird...i can't find a 'log' directory in $ORACLE_HOME/crs ah hali: how do I restart the whole database? am I supposed to do it directly in the windows services? yes how? or cmd line.. both work (aside from rebooting the machine) you should have a service in services.msc called oracleINSTANCE and oraclelistener hali: so I'm not suppposed to use cross-over cable for interconnect ? Sun doesn't warn me about it Vas: i've had a lot of problems with it.. most people recommend a pair of switches hali: in the task manager I see oracle.exe kaylee: check the services thinbgie thingie* hali: do I have to reinstall sun cluster if I put in the switches ? yeah, I tried stoping and starting from there, but didn't bring it back argh! cuz I remember when installing sun cluster, it asked whether i had switches or not now I see why the boss doesn't want any new apps using oracle Vas: perhaps thats a new feature then... it didn't used to do that but this is very fundamental flaw if it's true ... sun should have documented it well, not really.. it all depends on how you threat that ""problem"" ... what is a dead peer and what is bad interconnect and what is just a rebooting peer so you dont' think i need to reinstall the cluster software ? cuz that's a lot of work , now that oracle DB already has database on it brb I'm gunna try rebooting Vas: not sure, since i haven't seen that feature before you use SC 3.1 ? another point is that sun usually denies you support if you install sun cluster yourself cuz that's what i use hm, i think we have some 3.1 boxes.. not sure i don't have any memory of seing that question.. but it was probably there you 've never seen issue where rebooting one node, the instance on the other node also goes down ? not that it goes gown.. but i've seen tns issues since each node has it's own db_unique_name ... if there's only 2 nodes, do I need 2 switches or just one switch for both nodes ? you need one, you should have two high end one or a couple crappy linksys switches ok ? 30 bucks each cheapo as long as they are reliable yeah no kiddin' i think we use 3com 4200's you have one switch for each node ? or perhaps a pair of hp 2626 you have two interconnects right right one for each interconnect i'd really want to nail this problem though....i think it's something w/ my settings yes dig for logs... where the heck is crs logs if not in /u01/app/oracle/product/10.2.0/db_1/crs/log ? ah i know...that's not the right crs dir you should have sc errors in /var/adm/messages and /var/cluster/logs hali++ hali: also, I didn't register to let sun cluster to manage oracle rac yet, but that shoudl be ok as in, shutdown, startup, etc. I I rebooted, and now it seems to be doing fine reboot does wonder not on friday, eh meh pwrdwnsys hali: HADB comes with sun cluster or Oracle CRS software ? i saw you mentioned about it the other day, but couldn't find much info on it",0

"Does anyone know in canvas a good accurate way to get the height of text? I read rotating a W then getting the width but that adds a ton of overhead if i need to clear/redraw the canvas just to do that for each object in a frame There has to be a easier way? :F Have you tried context.measureText function? Yeah but that only does width, no? Which is silly mind you Oh height sorry... Check this out, you might get something. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1134586/how-can-you-find-the-height-of-text-on-an-html-canvas doesn't save() and restore() add a lot of overhead? expfist, I just wrote a library for that. This has to be done about 200-300 times per second Oh? http://pomax.github.com/fontmetrics.js but as always, it will be wise to cache metrics for reoccurring strings in your own program. Yeah problem is I'm allowing for dynamic resizing of text no worries, track the resize along with the intrinsic heigh. *height although if you're using ascii, a simple trick is to compute the heights for a-z and A-Z, then compute height(String) instead as maxHeight(each letter in string) this will be more efficient for relatively long strings. There is no quick way to draw an object then rotate it in an isolated space without affecting the existing context is there? buffer canvas. Is that like a hidden canvas? pretty much, yes. but you can also rotate by X, draw text, rotate by -X Let me try that again I did 180 measure, 180 And it tripped my animation out Hmm why did I do 180 heh Much better I'm a dumb ass",0

"a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2, do you have any insight into <http://bugzilla.validator.nu/show_bug.cgi?id=641>, or know who might? (FWIW: <http://validator.nu/?doc=http://www.wikipedia.org>) looks now 88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762: hsivonen would definitely have insight into that, if he had time to look at in detail. but I think his time for validator.nu bug fixing is limited right now. so in the mean time, I can take a look at it unless he beats me to it. Thanks. It's not urgent. OK, I've already been looking at that same code over the weekend, for the other bug you reported http://bugzilla.validator.nu/show_bug.cgi?id=640 I already have a fix written up for that partial fix Great. I'm sure some of the codes are actually wrong. When I can figure out which ones, I'll talk to our language people and get them replaced with more correct ones. 88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762: actually, most of them are not outright wrong -- there's a number of them that are valid, but deprecated like ""zh-yue"" -- that should just be ""yue"" instead Yeah, we know about most of those, I think. We've sort of accreted them over the years. well, the validator should not actually report those as errors Once we've set up a wiki, it's a pain to change the domain, and it doesn't really hurt anything to keep it, so we tend to leave it alone. yeah, understood (""we"" not really including me, I'm not a sysadmin and can't change the domains) It's easy to change the lang="""" attribute on that one page, though. OK. well please leave it for now if you can until we get this bug resolved No problem. It's a good test case. so anyway, validator.nu should just report those as warnings, not errors because they are not strictly conformance errors the problem is, in the current validator.nu datatype-checking code, there's no mechanism for emitting warnings about datatypes of attribute values it is currently only set up to emit error messages There are probably other cases where you'd want warnings for attribute values, but I can't think where offhand. yeah, I'm sure we will find some others, anyway 88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762: so I need to ask hsivonen for some guidance about what he thinks the best way to refine the code to emit warnings Okay, no problem. As I say, not urgent. OK",0

Thoughts? URL? http://tinyurl.com/kkzbk9 it's simple but I was going for""recognizable as microformats but specific to 4 yr. b-day... yikes - I'm not sure it's good to mutate the logo that much! yeah I wasn't sure.... did you have a chance to run it by Dan Cederholm to get his opinion? I should email him the linl\ link I just emailed him earlier tonight asking what the mf font was for the name ""microformats"" haven't heard back yet do you know what font he used? it's not on the site Jeremy and I both thought it was very much still recognizable as mf but specific to the b-day celebration but it's your call for sure :) My experience with corporate and non-profit brands is that typically you want to preserve at least the shape of a logo for any variant and high contrast elements thus for example, Cederholm created an orange variant of the microformats logo as well (you can find it on http://microformats.org/ if you find it) Tantek edited hcard-input-examples ""links to broader hcard-input effort, hcard-input-formats documentation, hcard-brainstorming"" (+136) http://is.gd/ZxEG Oh yeah totally. But I think the 3 parts cascading with the rounded edges and the white border keeps enough of the visual ties to the original logo even if it's in another color. It's a tough call but I honestly think so far that most people I've showed it to are like ""oh yeah, that's the mf logo as a #4"" I'm kind of hoping to get a bunch of peoples' input to see if it's syntactically relevant and then if most people (even the ones I know who have no clue what mf is) get the logo variation, then it works. If not, I've got a bunch of tricks up my sleeve :) We also really need to pick a venue w/in the next 2 days so we can start promoting (the sooner the better b/c we want to use this to raise $$$ for the devCamp). I was thinking that whatever logo/designs we go with should also have some code people can embed that allows users to download the vCalendar when clicked (microformatted hCalendar) yeah - the morphed logo really felt odd we could perhaps do something with small multiples rather than the number 4 yeah, I emailed Dan to see what he thinks too, but I've got a few other ideas for the embeddable banners/images do you know what the logo font is? I thought we had written it down on the wiki have you looked at the spread microformats page? http://microformats.org/wiki/spread-microformats yeah, I have. I was just trying to do something ""new"" - maybe too divergent though I'll have other comps by morning - Jeremy and I are on a caffine kick and are planning an all-nighter.... Tantek created hcard-input ""drafted"" http://is.gd/Zyfp I had a small cup of Ritual Coffee Roasters coffee myself so I'm cranking away on hCard copy+paste doing research, brainstorming, iterating Oh so what if we did the 4's logo with the microformats embedded icon in the corner with text? sorry I'm not trying to push this too hard, I just really think it can work. I like this better than other ideas because it also brands the ""event"" which is important if you want ###'s to show up I also emailed a few venues as well since Varnish is $350/hr minimum yeah Varnish seems a bit steep Although I also talked to Jeremy and Object Adjective could sponsor one of those hours (basically we could be good for about $350) that's very generous of you! let's make sure your donation would be maximally efficiently spent Yeah totally I've requested reserving the upstairs at 21st Amendment as a possibility it would limit the size of the party - but it's a start I don't want to just buy people drinks - I want to find the best venue where people can talk, eat and maybe have a few brief speakers (so not packed with other loud clientelle) yeah but right now, I want to lock down *something* that we know we can afford and then we can upgrade from there Yeah I was worried about the 38 person for sit-down limit - if we do it early enough (before 7pm) many people will want food options Although I know a party planner who is really awesome & might have some catering options if we did it somewhere that didn't have food Another possibility would be doing it at Root Division simplest is just appetizers and cash bar - no sit down and start the party later like 8pm I'm a studio resident there - we would have to get the bevs and food, but we could work off of donations & peoples' pot luck enthusiasm yeah that totally makes sense go ahead an add additional venue suggestions to the wiki page with details off the top of your head helps to have them in one place to compare/contrast There were a few other places I was considering listing but it depends what our party size is How many peeps do you think will show up? any clue? b/c I have a sense of venues of all sizes I just need to know a rough min/max it's tough b/c we're looking at either a friday or saturday night on short notice... right so pick a few you like and list rough capacities and cost info if you have them too Tantek created hcard-input-formats ""drafted with only hCard input previous format example found so far, Microsoft VCARD_NAME schema"" http://is.gd/ZyPq The other thing is we could do it at Jeremy and my apt. (it's 1600 sq feet) and just buy alcohol/kegs and I could cater the food myself (used to be a chef at a northern Italian cuisine restaurant) Since it's our office we could say it's at Object Adjective hq if we wanted to save $ that's also a very generous offer! let's see if we can do it at a venue so that we don't have to compromise your personal space but that's a good backup to keep in mind - feel free to list that as a last ditch option I don't mind (it's good motivation to clean) - and I love hosting parties - as long as 1-2 peeps sign up for clean up duty to help me the next day :P Tantek created hcard-input-brainstorming ""drafted with rough outline of proposal thoughts, noted a couple of issues off the top of my head based on experience with real world examples so far"" http://is.gd/Zz3J Even if they don't I love throwing parties. It's a good fun time to get people together talking about geeky things and having fun and i like to cook Another place that isn't too obnoxious about charging parties is Nihon Whiskey Lounge on Folsom St. Jeremy had my b-day there 2 years ago and they were very accommodating - could get the private room for purchasing 1 or 2 bottles of premier alcohol (food was for order on demand but they might cater if we talk to them about a large group) - they;re only good for about maybe 30-35 tops but it's a really private comfy space so i go ahead and add all your suggestion to the wiki page like I said - hard to consider in a stream in IRC - better to compare/contrast ugh I'm just afraid I'll overcrowd it & drive everyone nuts - I was going to get quotes and then add the possibilities since I can think of about 20 places off-hand Give me 1 day of phoning around (on no sleep, which oddly makes me more shrewd) and I'll post the realistic possibilities. It would help though if we had a rough count - or at least a minimum and absolute maximum (could be totally inflated) b/c I would love to find a place that could accommodate any # and not feel empty if only 20 - 30 show up don't worry about ""overcrowd"" and don't wait to get quotes that's the whole point of a wiki just add incremental bits of info when you have it rather than collecting it until some point of ""completeness"" Okay. I'll end up posting about 10 places then we have no idea for count because we'll likely do explicit invites based on capacity so it's a bit of a circular problem hard to find spaces that scale like that but I would like to thin it down to ones that cost less baseline than $350 / hr and can accommodate 30-50 people at least but probably not more than 100 at a time ... that's my guess We shouldn't be explicit though - not if we're trying to raise $$ for the DevCamp We want lots of people to show up, buy merch, etc Sorry I'm being too business-like but it's the truth; we need a lot of people if we're only asking for X at the door explicit meaning directly contacting people in addition to organic explicit != exclusive hi rohit 0de0bf7c8cc4c5700f6370db825561a7 has been a lot of good work trying to figure things out for the party probably too much - I am a bit of a neurotic (no kidding?) but I think we all agree that we need the cheapest, most accommodating option that can book us for a week from Fri or Sat - yikes! We can do this though even if we need to do Varnish and get sponsors - or have it at Object Adjective hq either one would have plenty of space and our home/office is free - but not sure if it's too non-event-ish to do it at a dev. company's home/office? I think the 21st Amendment reservation may be free too and that way we don't have to worry as much about food + drink logistics we can still do some sponsorship Yeah, that would totally be fine - as long as they've got the space and they won't be jerks. I know when J and I went to CromaticSF last week we went there afterward and they were total assholes to the crowd we came with b/c not everyone wanted to order dinner - I know we won't be in the dining room, but it just left a bad taste in my mouth.... I would hate to have them book us upstairs and then let other loud roudy patrons up there to drink beer and watch sports.... thanks for all your help, 0de0bf7c8cc4c5700f6370db825561a7 you're making me wish I could be there! :) (i'll be in NYC unfortunately) unless there's enough uf'ers in nyc!... well we can always set up a live feed if you plan your own party on the east coast :) 0de0bf7c8cc4c5700f6370db825561a7 - when they book the upstairs - they put up a sign saying private party I know this because we've been there before when other groups have booked it (ref: 21A) Oh well then I'm going to chill out and not hate on 21st at least about private parties :P I am also taking this time to write to all of my friends at the various web firms, software companies, etc. and try to get sponsorship Have we gotten any others yet beside ObjAdj?

"female? i hope so no one is talking hi yeah and you? well good, what do u wanna talk about? n im a male everything u like I just have nothing to do so i want to talk to someone well thats a broad subject considering the fact my mind is somewhat in the gutter, but would u judge me if i told u i wrote stories? oh, what u write, it's so interesting i write stories that ive been told are extremely good, but explaining them is kinda hard :/ the one i started most recently is about a vampire society vampire! i like twilight, and i like vampires its far from twilight,very far it's about the vampire society, i'm interested in that yeah, its based on how vampires there dnt want another war between them vs a mix of a demon,human, werewolf and wyvern army so they try to make it to where they are accepted and allowed amongst humans please, i wondered where are u come from usa oh, i think that guys would like it! georgia my family loves my stories, my brother calls dibs on all the ones i write (too bad most get lost on the comp) but yeah they are so good my mom was going to look into me taking a technical writing class so that id be able to get my stories published brb",0

"hey im pissed off, can i vent Sure :) ok, i really hate my girlfriend sometimes she calls me right befor i go to bed and we talk for a little while like 5 minutes That's all? and then i try to go to bed and she complains about how she cant even talk to me for 5 seconds and how i should be a better boyfriend and we fight constantly she takes life for granted Well, couldn't you call her a little earlier, like, before you're ready to go to bed? If it's really that big a deal, why are you still with her? i try, we talk a 9 o'clock cause i love her but im not sure how much i can take and its impossible to talk to her I'm sorry, maybe I'm not understanding, but it seems like the problem is that she just wants to talk to you more. she calls and texts alot maybe im jsut being selfish, but i like my space Well, that's understandable. But sometimes you can't control how you feel. I know, for me personally, it was different for each relationship I was in. Sometimes, there are people who just make you feel better. Maybe that's how it is for her. yeah....your right. i try to be flexible, i really do, maybe im just to flexible too* How old are you? 18 Hm, I hope you can work it out. If it was me, i'd just try talking to her about it. Don't get mad and frustrated, just tell her that you care about her and want to spend time with her and talk to her, but sometimes you just want some space. If she really cares about you, she should understand ok, i appreciate the listening thank you Of course :) bye",0

"I'm trying to write a web accessible user interface to iptables to block IP addresses. Is there anyway to add a block on an IP address only if it doesn't already exist? (Or will I have to write my own routines to check). For example, I'll have a cronjob setup to read an external file of banned IP's and the script will add them to iptables (if needed). if you wanted to, you could use ipset or recent to do the IP checking ipset would be better for it, but requires a kernel patch, whilee recent is alreay in the kernel you just echo ip > /proc/net/ipt_recent/BLOCK; iptables -A INPUT -m recent --rcheck --name BLOCK -j DROP hmm, doesn't look like I have either of them (Debian 3.1) really? how did you test that? I just tried changing directories to /proc/net and there isn't any ipt_recent of course, you probably don't have the module loaded modprobe ipt_recent ok, now I've got it you need to insert the rule first; it will create the files in the directory I'm little confused about forward chain. Traffic passing in Forward is 1) SNAT from users or 2) Being DNAT into internal servers, right ? (anything else?) it is anything that is routed by the machine - everything not destined for it, or generated by it I understand that, but I cant think of any other form of traffic other than SNAT/DNAT? anything specific ? consider a _normal_ router - all the traffic would go through without any NAT or, if you had two local networks, traffic between the two would also go through FORWARD hmm thanks .. one more thing .. what are the recommended /proc settings? I know about tcp_syncookies & rp_filter, anything else worth noticing ? only other one I know of is /proc/sys/net/netfilter/ip_conntrack_tcp_loose - set it to zero about 20 minutes after a reboot of the router that lets the router pick up already-established connections duh! did I miss a message over that netsplit?! (I only got ""that lets the router pick up already-established connections"") > the only other one I know of is /proc/sys/net/netfilter/ip_conntrack_tcp_loose - set it to zero about 20 minutes after a reboot of the router thnx ... I am thinking rp_filter is useless as well, if I make FORWARD policy DROP, right? and only forward packets, internal 2 output rp_filter might still be useful - don't disable it unless you have a reason just in case :) you are correct that it won't make any difference though also, a rule blocking spoofed packets coming on public interface such as iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -s 192.168.0.0/24 -j DROP is useless if I am using rp_filter, correct ? I think so thanks man .. why would --state NEW, be better than --syn ? (if it is) it handles UDP, and it uses the conntrack instead of just the TCP flags what's the meaning of (-s 0/0 -d 0/0 ) no meaning iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -s 0/0 -d 0/0 --destination-port 80 --syn -j ACCEPT is exactly identical to iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 --syn -j ACCEPT oh ok .. otherwise, -s and -d specify soruce & destination IPs If I run a mailserver behind a firewall, I *have* to DNAT to the mail server, right? It is never accessible in any direct *forwarding* manner ? perhaps maybe if the mailserver has a real IP?! if the mailserver has a real IP, the router could route things to it but the router would have to know the IP and have a route for it (or the mailserver would need its own connection to the internet) yeah ... so if it has a 192.168 IP, then I have to DNAT ? yes If I query my ISP DNS server, the reply is sent over UDP. Would this be considered (ESTABLISHED,RELATED) ? ESTABLISHED hmmm... ESTABLISHED is the state of the TCP connection - it could also be FIN_WAIT or other things maxine: so would an INPUT ESTABLISHED rule let it in ? kimo: wish i knew maxine is a bot danieldg: weird, UDP is connectionless ! but conntrack tracks it anyway but how does it track it ? (packet timing?) yep, timing and port numbers smart little genie :) is there "" -j DENY"" ! -j DROP or -j REJECT? yeah! using custom chains, is purely for performance optimization, AFAIK, correct ? there are other reasons too but mostly yes thanks ... I'm presenting about iptables tomorrow, what are some interesting modules for netfilter ?? (I know about -m limit, recent) owner, for outbound filtering who would put users on gateway machine :) well, you can have a firewall on a server... ;) u32, for arbitrary packet inspection maybe ipp2p I think u32 and ipp2p require a kernel patch thnx .. ipp2p does sound very interesting just a weird question ... say I have webserver, and all other service are closed (nmap only finds port 80 open), why would a firewall still be important to run on such a host!! an outbound firewall might be useful why it could prevent any outbound connections by the UID of the webserver so when some script kidde finds an exploit on your server, he can't get it to download anything for him yeah ... but most of the work goes into filtering input chain, and usually there is no server listening there. Seems like firewalling in general is not so important, unless someone forgets a server running by mistake! or am I horribly mistaken! mostly, yes it does help if you start a service by accident / is started by installer without your knowledge :) You cant beleive how many people think of a FW as the network security silver bullet kinda... not running stuff as root is also good yeah, but local priv escalation is not so difficult these days I'm running oracle on real IPs and wish I could make a selinux policy for them. The policy is just darn hard to play with! what's a use for mangle. I have never seen it doing anything useful! changing TTL or TOS bits using MARK for QoS can u give a real world example please. ie match to what to perform what? I've neber played with TOS or QoS :) never* <a href=""http://lartc.org/howto/lartc.netfilter.html"">http://lartc.org/howto/lartc.netfilter.html</a> thnx ..",0

"""When the user views a 'my accounts' page in his browser, she sees what information the site is storing about her."" https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Weave/Identity/Account_Manager/Spec/Latest That's gender-neutrality taken to an extreme, there. People just need to accept that singular ""they"" is valid. Freaking *Shakespeare* used it. So does the Bible. Which has the even worse problem that all nouns, adjectives, and verbs are gendered, let alone pronouns. (At least the Hebrew and Aramaic parts.) It's hopeless to even think about trying ""he or she""-type constructions in that setting. Wait, are you talking about the bible in hebrew, or in one of the english translations? Well, in Hebrew, but I assume the translations follow suit. Let me see. Deuteronomy 17:5: ""Then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, which have committed that wicked thing, unto thy gates, even that man or that woman, and shalt stone them with stones, till they die."" That's KJV. NIV paraphrases, as usual. I avoid NIV like the plague for that reason (when I'm using a Christian translation for whatever reason). Nice and readable, because they translate it to mean whatever they happen to think it should mean. Some really egregious cases there. Of course, the same is somewhat true for any translation, but NIV is way worse than more word-for-word translations like KJV in that regard. . . . I'm really curious to know if people have examples of real-world (malicious, not proof-of-concept) MITM attacks on the web. Maybe they've been averted by the fact that even incompetent banks/e-commerce sites/whatever tend to use HTTPS. So they get the little padlock, or to comply with some industry certification or law or something, I don't know. I think that basically *everyone* uses https who needs it. Pretty sure it's law, in the case of banks and similar. So it might be hard to find actual examples, simply because the ecosystem is so defensive against it in the first place. We do have federal wiretapping in the US. That's passive MITM as far as we know, no changes being done to the stream, but it's a definite example of the scenario. And in terms of personal attacks, Hixie commits MITM attacks against people using his network on occasion. Just when they're abusing it, and nothing bad, but again, that's an attack scenario. I guess. Anyone using a wifi connection they don't own is subject to the owner doing things like that. Also: http://www.ex-parrot.com/pete/upside-down-ternet.html Yeah, very similar. None of this is malicious, though, or something web developers have to worry about in practice. Most web developers, I mean. Authoritarian governments doing wiretapping is something that a web author interested in privacy has to worry about. That's not the average author, but still. Well, you can't do anything in that case. Because one, they can probably forge an SSL certificate. Okay, true. As long as they have at least one root CA in their country. And two, they can still tell what IP address you're connecting to, so unless it's a big shared host or you're using something else like TOR, they can still tell where you're going. Which is enough for them to jail you already, if they felt like it. Yeah, but that's a separate security issue entirely. Encryption can't help with that at all. No, you need some form of indirection as well. It's still a MITM attack, though. And worth pointing out. If you're trying to hide your activities from the government, and they can get enough info to arrest you or search your computer anyway, then the technology isn't helping. What, peeping your IP? Not necessarily. Everyone in the chain knows your IP. Well, yes. Everyone in the chain (if by that you mean the path between client and server) is a MITM. If they bother. Okay, yeah, you're right. Anyway, against repressive governments you've pretty much lost from the start. You need social solutions to that, not technical. I mean, even if you used TOR, they could throw you in jail or ransack your house or whatever just for that. Modern, well-organized governments are essentially invincible to any kind of internal revolt, other than a military coup. True. I guess you can pressure them in some ways, but technology isn't going to much help you to hide from them. It does help make it harder for them to control information, though. . . . anyway. Whatever the case may be, any security scenario where you're trying to defend against a government or comparably powerful organization needs to be treated as an entirely separate category. It shouldn't even be brought up in general, if it's just a general web security discussion. So we're back to (a) open wifi means that the owner can snoop and alter your traffic easily and (b) anyone in the normal chain of routers between you and the target can do the same. But right now, SSL's security against MITM and general ubiquity in cases where MITM would be a profitable exploit means that actual example of MITM are necessarily going to be few and far between. Yep. I'd still like to see one real-world (malicious, non-government) case, though. :) I'd have to poke around, and I don't feel like doing that.

"re what does it mean??? yassine, ""returned"" I guess :) reloaded :) jbalint, what the difference between loading classes from common/lib and from WEB-INF/lib from tomcat perspective WEB-INF/lib is loaded by a separate classloader for each application and each ""instance"" of each application (which usually isn't be can occassionaly be an important distinction) :) from the performence view which one is better ? Neither I guess. I personally NEVER use common/lib. jbalint, well since im planing to use hibernate its also suggested to store jdbc driver in the WEB-INF/lib That's how I do it. but since the whole container will only host one application i was wondering if its not better storing it in the common/lib i just want an optimized use of my resource and looking for the best way to get that done I think this should be a very low-priority issue. :) so you think its not really affecting the use of resources ?

Most of the more complex C++ code is just scaffolding to get input and output in the right places, and an OCaml program generates the code for the actual tokenisation algorithm (and that could be easily adpated to create plain C instead of C++) nods (since it's already adapted to produce JS (http://canvex.lazyilluminati.com/misc/parser/tokeniser.html) and Perl too) I believe he had proposed porting html5lib to C, but he would be happier to do it if there was a group of people to maintain that and the other ports (e.g. the Ruby one) right, yeah, that's what I recall him having said In theory, my approach means I can maintain the C++/JS/Perl implementations simultaneously by only changing one file, though I have no idea how well that'll work in practice since there haven't been any spec changes since I wrote it ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c - what about performance of the code generated in those target languages from your OCaml source? Does it perform as well as if it were authored natively in the target languages? Particularly the C++ code? As far as I can tell, the C++ one is close to that - it's a couple of hundred times faster than Python, and I think a few times faster than Java, and I've not been able to think of any manual changes that improve it measurably If there are things that would help, the OCaml code already does some simple optimisations before generating the target code and it can probably recognise and transform other patterns (The generated C++ is pretty much identical to http://canvex.lazyilluminati.com/misc/parser/tokeniser_auto.js) (though the generated Perl is quite differently structured, since it doesn't do 'switch') (When I last looked, most of the time in the C++ code was spent in allocating memory for strings and in reading from the input stream, which is in the manually-written part - fixing those made it a couple of times faster) ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c - thanks. I don't ask out of any particular concern about its performance but mostly because I think it's a concern that others might ask. But from what you describe, seems like it's a very ""portable"" algorithm if that's an accurate way to describe something such as that",0

"hi Hi there b5f36805a40efe87130ca9a70858457d. Hi Tyler How was the weekend? thanks for asking, a real smash :-) Lovely! c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca, had a good time friday playing jazz (autumn leaves, etc... :-) Then went to Berlin on Sunday, still there, we celebrate the 50. anniversity of the European Union over here Very nice! Lots of parties and such? And Jazz eh? I'm a big fan of the stuff. c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca, cool, glad you like it c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca, its quite fun, I tend to move between free music and jazz back and forth over time and this very related to what we are doing here like sometimes, I really just want to play without thinking too much and I end up with funk like 2 or 4 chords but then, every now and then Very nice. :) u miss those harmonies and u only get them if you thoroughly study jazz standards None of my mails are on the list :( c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca, so just a lot like adherend strictly to a declarative spec Ah see, I just enjoy listening. :) while funk is more like scripting along... Hehe yeah, jazz standards are quite restrictive u need to get those harmonic changes right otherwise it dosn't sound nice nods. whereas e.g. funk is more open and forgiving but it can easily end up in a mess then especially when playing together with more people So then whom would be the version control? ;) c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca, interesting one... in jazz, you have about one or two dozen chords per song so when improvising, you get so much room and possibilities, you can stay in the one big version and evolve within in with simpler music you really need to stop playing and tell the other musicians that something is changing now, otherwise it gets dull, so you need versioning of course, you can continue to play and shout at the other musicion a harmonic change but thats a hack you then yell on stage WE'RE GOING TO A MINOR NOW, OK? :) :-) I'll be back in a few. Morning stand-up at the office, wee! 'k, later... That would be a good analogy for <svg> and <math> elements. The document shouting ""WE'RE GOING TO SVG MODE NOW, OK?"" to the parser a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9, :-) And then the parser goes ""Eh, A minor? I haven't learned that one yet"" weren't namespaces meant for this? b5f36805a40efe87130ca9a70858457d: HTML can't really have namespaces SGML-based HTML, right there is no SGML-based HTML",0

"Omegle has video now hi holy balls i know rip-off ending up being like chatroulette yep Basically have you tried it (omegle video)? My friends are using it now on another laptop talking to some 15-year-old girl who is a 15-year-old girl because you can see that it is 'cause there's video! :P it works pretty bad so, who are you then? Yeah But they just set it up Some random dude Who are you? hehe just a dude at work you do know, that both chatroulette and omegle video chat can be faked using manycam? Oh yeah? ha yep I'm sick of all the masturbators what are they thinking? I mean, even if they're going for the freak-out factor they get like 2 seconds, then the person nexts them how could it be worth it? they should call it dickroulette instead... lol just try this, take a piece of paper, set a X for each dick you see, and at the end of a 20 minute periode, you'll have atleast 20 x it's just so sad Haha Bored day at work?

"http://canvex.lazyilluminati.com/misc/states6.png - now with fewer bugs than before, since implementation seems to pass most of the tests now *the implementation yay squiggly lines ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: what's the difference between red and black lines? (Oh, I segfault on <x y=""&"">, which can't be good) an especially squiggly red one going from CommentEndDash to Data f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: Red is transitions that are parse errors, black is transitions that probably aren't ok (""probably"" because of the parse-error-unless-it's-a-permitted-slash thing, which the graph treats as not-an-error) that's awesome why not have a red line and a black line when you have the permitted slash thing? you do that elsewhere yay, bogus doctype only has red arrows leading to it same with bogus comment, yay you really should use another colour for the EOF transitions in fact maybe we should have an EOF state instead of having EOF go back to the dat astate I can't easily have both because I only generate one arrow per transition from the original algorithm, and then delete all duplicates, so it only ends up with red+black when there are two separate transitions between the same states ah ok didn't realise it came from actual code that graph is awesome It's not entirely actual code - the algorithm is represented as data in OCaml, and I can generate that graph or a C++ implementation from that data it shows that there are really three basic ideas aah cool is there any reason why you couldn't generate a, say, Python or Ruby implementation from that data? http://canvex.lazyilluminati.com/misc/states7.png - unless I did something wrong, that has blue lines for every transition that cannot occur if EOF is never consumed (i.e. all the transitions that are (at least partially) caused by EOF) can you try it with a separate state for EOF? or is that more effort than it's worth? it'd be cool to have the arrows go down to another state for EOF, it would look less cluttered i'd think just an idea, don't worry about it if it's more work than a few seconds :-) a480104b0e570389c6f4284a88c7cd9d: I don't think there is any reason why that wouldn't work this is really cool I've still had to manually write a few hundred lines of C++ (which would need to be ported to other languages), mostly for the entity parsing (since that's too boring to do in a more generic way), but then it generates a thousand lines of state-machine code automatically I don't know O'Caml, but this sounds like a wonderful excuse to learn. Will you be publishing your source at some point? I didn't know it either, so I'm using it as exactly the same excuse ;-) I'll try to upload what I've done soonish looks like it could be used to generate code coverage testcases too I'm sure there must be a way to add in a new EOF state in about three lines of code, but I'm also sure they'll take a few minutes to work out... http://canvex.lazyilluminati.com/misc/states8.png (Hmm, it took fourteen lines) sweet that's totally awesome Now I just need to make it able to generate the spec text from the algorithm ;-) hah wonders if people have experience of how much more time it takes to implement tree construction compared to tokenisation about twice as long to write, about three times as long to debug, iirc but it's not especially hard just tedious why is there a blue arrow from data to data? Because I modified the algorithm so any case which is triggered by EOF and causes a transition into the Data state, was changed to transition into the EOFData state but the relevant part inside the Data state bit of the algorithm doesn't transition into the Data state (because I didn't bother writing in the ""stay in the same state"" bits explicitly) so that could be considered a bug in my old-algorithm-to-new-algorithm transformation code, but it'd require too much effort to fix :-) Hmm, it's far too easy to get exponential growth in these things http://canvex.lazyilluminati.com/misc/states9.png - I'm not sure why it's gone quite that bad holy crap what the hell is that states * pcdata etc? Yes I suppose it's unhappy because lots of states emit start/end tag tokens when they see EOF, and the tokeniser can't tell what the tree constructor is going to do to the content model flag when that happens, so I assume it could end up being set to anything, which causes unpleasant growth (""I assume"" = ""I tell the code to assume"") Looks like that is the case - http://canvex.lazyilluminati.com/misc/states10.png is far better without the EOFs ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: what are you using to create those flow charts? Graphviz (It does tend to collapse into a mass of unreadable squiggles when you get past a certain size, and I always tend to use it on things that approach that size, but I've not heard of anything else that does the same kind of thing) (Uh, ""same kind of thing"" = drawing graphs, not collapsing into squiggles) What is whatwg ? u mean this channel? The website needs an 'about' link I just saw the site in a slashdot sig, went there and was not sure how it related to silverlight is it some kind of social front end to w3c's html specifications? 88efc6feb6704817d8ffe8449b5d135f: see http://blog.whatwg.org/faq/#whattf 88efc6feb6704817d8ffe8449b5d135f: we're basically the renegade group that started html5 My entirely unoptimised C++ tokeniser (which no longer segfaults) takes about 0.4 seconds for the HTML5 spec, which doesn't seem too bad (It's certainly a bit useless, because it just computes all the tokens and then memory-leaks them away) ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: yeah tokenising is easy ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: the tree construction is definitely the more expensive part",0

I don't know either I thought I'd put it under ""Details"", but that's really for proposing what to enter into the spec http://dev.w3.org/html5/decision-policy/decision-policy.html#change-proposal <- doesn't really describe what a counter change proposal should include looking at this http://www.w3.org/html/wg/wiki/ChangeProposals/KeepMicrodata it seems the ""Rationale"" section needs to contain the details let's remove the ""Details"" header then are you editing? not right now I'm done for today I think, but I'm monitoring it and might throw and some stuff if you don't object uh throw in, as in add, not throw as in remove :) sure I am about to go to bed, so will likely not edit anything in about 15 hours (have to take my son to Basketball in the morning) have a nice weekend, then :) thanks :-) you, too I'll monitor the situation :-) nn ... g+ seriously doesn't do rss? what?",0

"jacquez, hi ... what doctype are you using and how are you serving your html? jacquez, do you have a link to one of your pages? none of my pages are on the web, yet. I am just testing them and I see the accents are coming up funny. webben: <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN"" ""<a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd"">"">http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd""></a> jacquez: are these going to be public pages? yes how are you going to serve pages to internet explorer users? hi, should i use 'get' method to send an image or should i use 'post'? jacquez: or to ask the question another way, why are you using XHTML 1.1? I'm not sure I am using a template is that reason? what template? (it's not necessarily a good reason, but it depends what sort of pages these are going to be) most web work should be in html 4.01 strict or xhtml 1.0 strict (which one is best is a matter of tedious and frustrating debate) i certainly wouldn't recommend using 1.1 for public pages unless you have a special reason for doing so as you can't serve it to IE users (i will try and answer your accents question too, but it's important that you're using the right markup language first) what sort of pages are these? do they include mathematical formulae for instance? where did the template come from? oswd.org no math involved just foreign names and such yeah ... you need to find a template for HTML 4.01 Strict or failing that XHTML 1.0 Strict and that will fix my problem? it will save you from massive problems that you haven't encountered yet because your pages aren't online what about with the accents and other stuff? jacquez: i haven't had to deal with the accents problem with XHTML 1.1 (i don't use it because it has little real-world application yet, as IE users can't access it) ... but i assume the accents situation is the same as in XHTML 1.0 you need to specify an encoding in the xml prologue (with XHTML 1.1 only) why can't IE users access it? and you need to specify a charset in a meta tag and you need to save your document in your text editor as the same encoding and basically the only encoding you want to use is UTF-8 (unless you happen to be doing work in japanese) and to be double sure that users of old browsers can read your accents, you should probably encode them as numeric character references a really quick way to find out the NCR of any character is to use this wonderful page: <a href=""http://people.w3.org/rishida/scripts/uniview/conversion"">http://people.w3.org/rishida/scripts/uniview/conversion</a> stick an accented character in the Character box, click one of the other boxes and they'll all fill up with their different encodings of that character you'll want decimal NCRs so ?Â© (e acute) is &#233; that is a lot of work jacquez: IE users can't access it because, unlike XHTML 1.0, XHTML 1.1 cannot be served with a mime type of ""text/html"" so what happens when they come to my site? because one of the key aims of XHTML 1.1 was to force xml parsing rather than html parsing of the markup jacquez: i suspect (i haven't tried it) that IE will either try and download the file (not render it), or display it as XML (i.e. display the markup rather than rendering it) i changed everything to UTF-8 and the accents work but please trust me: if you don't know whether you want to be serving XHTML 1.1: you definitely shouldn't be serving XHTML 1.1 jacquez: yes ... they should work fine in modern browsers so I can chage the DOC type easily? jacquez: it depends how much you care about people with older browsers, whether you also use NCRs I'm not going to be using NCR's for the most part jacquez: if I were you (unless there's some special reason not to), I'd just go find a template designed for the doctype you want to use if you do decide to try and adapt the existing template, the easiest, though not necessarily best, thing to do would be to change it to xhtml 1.0 although its substantial work whether you go that way or to html 4.01 because if you use xhtml 1.0, you need to follow Section C of the spec (in order to serve pages to ... you guessed it .. internet explorer) hmm basically xhtml 1.0 was designed so that you could write it in a way that IE could read it XHTML 1.1 was trying to move beyond that entirely HTML 4.01 is the simplest solution, because everyone (virtually) can read it and it can always be served as text/html but again, i'd say just go find a different template if you're not sure what you're doing here's the HTML 4.01 spec: <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/"">http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/</a> here's the XHTML 1.0 spec: <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/"">http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/</a> and the XHTML 1.1 spec: <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/"">http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/</a> here's an introduction to these pesky media types: <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-media-types/"">http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-media-types/</a> and here's an argument for you to just use HTML 4.01: <a href=""http://hixie.ch/advocacy/xhtml"">http://hixie.ch/advocacy/xhtml</a> so does anyone use XHTML 1.1? jacquez: yes, but not people with your use-case jacquez: mainly people who need to extend HTML (that's what the X is for) with other markup such as MathML for maths and some people on the cutting edge of web development like to use it And SVG! is internet exploror planning in catching up anytime soon jacquez: ""soon"" no jacquez: if you meet any web designers and they seem irritable, that's probably why after about a year's development, MS is gearing up to releasing IE 7. That fixes some of the more horrendous bugs in IE 6's treatment of basic HTML and CSS. Why do people use IE? does it even have tabbed browsing? I never used the thing in my entire life IE7 will have tabbed There are a variety of reasons e.g. it came with the computer, it's what the organization uses, it's habit (people just plain like what they're used to and don't like change) IE should be made illegal some people (a decreasing number) don't understand the difference between ""The Internet"" and ""Internet Explorer"" also, many corporate intranet web applications are built on IE's featureset and won't work with any other browsers and corporations don't change systems at the drop of a hat (a lot of them still are using Windows NT) IE6 will be with us with many many many years to come holding back the pace of web development heh, what a shame indeed jacquez: sorry to drop such a complex mess in your lap in response to what must have seemed a straightforward question about accents hehe... thanks, I am glad you told me those things jacquez: no problem :)",0

"Howdy or aloha Your pick You can have another greeting on request though. I take requests. Anything will do really, I'm not picky In that cae: Ba weep granna weep ni-ni bon Ever heard that before? I'd be impressed if you recognized it. It's a total dork reference and I think I spelled it wrong It's from the '80s. It's from an animated movie. The animated movie was based on a toy. It was a much better movie than you'd guess based on what I've said so far. I'm trying to think... hmmm Michael Bay directed the modern version. The modern version is terrible. When was the modern one made? There were two. I think they were '07 and '09 They had Shia LeBeouf Are you getting bored with the guessing game yet? Thought so... Haha Transformerssss Yesss The '80s Transformers movie was suprrisingly good Especially if you like cool drawings of robots wrestling I myself have never seen it.. and lines like ""I'll rip out your optics!"" Man I love that stuff, haha I'm getting the imprsesion that you're the type of person I like to talk to. I'm getting the same type of impression, ha My name is Brian. I'm 20, American. My names Jenna-Lorraine, and I'm 4 years younger then you and from Canada. That's cool. When I was your age, I was convinced I would go to college in Canada and then I didn't. I might go to college in Canada someday. I'm considering transfer options these day. I say you should, it's good down here, I can't wait to go. To college? Yeppers What do you think you'll be doing in college? Massage Therapy for sure, I have all my highschool classes lined up so I can be accepted for that. Massage therapy? That is an interesting career Ha, I get that a lot . You get paid extremely well, so that's a plus I can see the appeals in it for sure. Like I would be interested in being good at massage, in large part for being better at pleasing lovers Hahaha, very true. Because I imagine most of that knowledge would be really useful in such an arena. Is that a consideration from you? Or is your interest in massage more wholesome? It's more for the benefit of other, then for sexual pleasure, but hey, if I find a guy because of it, that works too. I can't imagine you'd want to date any of your clients, but those are skills that can make a guy who likes you really like you. I would never date a client ,that would be odd.. But I feel a little odd about the way this conversation is moving because you're jailbait and I'm a legal adult. So let's switch gears What is something fascinating to you? Ha, I agree I'm glad we remain on similar pages. It is like we got the same manual of how to converse on Omegle --but fascinating things. What are they? Haha, I have had way to many bad conversations on here.. Anyway yes.. So have I. The creepiest one was this guy who wanted to trade pictures of female friends on Facebook. Like he sent me some of an Asian girl he apparently knew and was like, ""Do you like her? I have more if you trade me more pictures like this."" And I was like ""I am happy to talk to someone creepy but I don't want to help you do creepy things"" and he disconnected. I find it fascinating that we find it necessary to explore space so vigerously when we have so much to still find right here on our own planet. Hhaahha that's too funny. Well I think the hope is that somewhere out there, there are more resources Rather than simply more space Beause if it were an isue of space alone, it wouldn't be an issue. Maybe in outer space, there's a giant ball of gasoline that we can just stick a straw in and suck it down to Earth And then we pray that no smartass sets it on fire Very true.. And of course there's the hope that we'll find aliens we can talk to and trade stuff with but that is much less likely. Have you ever read a short story called ""They're Made of Meat?"" No, sounds interesting.. I don't want to spoil it for you. It's a quick and short read. You can easily find it with a Google search It's like maybe 3 pages There's a short film adaptation to which is easily the worst adaptation anyone ever put effort into. Ooh, I'll look it up for sure. They somehow manage to make every cool part of the story into crap They get rid of the last line which was a minor twist, they changed who the main characters were which also changed their perspective and the actors delivered everything in a dead pan that made really funny dialogue seem repetitive and impotent So only watch that if you want to see how you can get every thing wrong Wow, what a bummer, eh.. The second worst adpation of text to film in my opinion is Catch-22 which is again, sort of entertaining, a clear work of effort but it makes the terrible mistake of missing all the important details and thus getting the tone wrong",0

"69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: still there? hey so I think async should have meaning always *but* that always makes sense if I get my other suggestion, that i haven't sent to the list yet, goes through so Gecko today always executs scripts in the order they were inserted into the DOM in order to not have interdependency issues i'm told webkit doesn't do that nor does html5 now i know as you suggested :-) well, i just suggested to change async, so far i'm curious what IE does i'm sort of worried about changing geckos behavior, that dynamically created scripts are essentially always async s/that/so that/ i totally think that async should always execute as-soon-as-possible-order-doesn't-matter we don't seem to have problems with programatically added scripts executing async, but it's entirely possible that it causes subtle compat issues that we just haven't diagnosed yet though I tend to suspect not yeah, i'm of split mind, which is why i want to test in IE but obviously it's hard to tell how some of these edge case behavior differences impact the long tail of the Web right we did have some kind of bug reports on dynamically inserted scripts (can't remember if it didn't work at all or something...) lemme search the ChangeLogs we had a bug where a dynamically insered script that removed itself would cause a crash (so we've seen at least some examples of people doing strange things) on the web? people doing strange things? surely you jest surely, sir that seems highly unlikely hmm, speaking of <script>, one thing we recently did is stop executing scripts with a ""for"" attribute https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=21193 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: ouch 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: i know we ended up with some hacks for that 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: back in the day gecko actually supported the ""for"" and ""event"" attributes. But only in embedded environments i think I'm not sure we want to actually implement <script for>, but since it doesn't seem viable to completely ignore it, it would be good to agree on some interoperable behavior 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: ugh, i should have removed that from gecko a long time ago well i'm happy to just say ""if there's a for attribute, abort these steps"" somewhere 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: yeah, i definitely don't want to implement for fully file a bug :-) 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: lemme check what gecko does c480405f460f7a61964569640a6cd059: ok 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: will do once we figure out what should happen k thanks this stuff is nasty so if ""for"" or ""event"" is missing, process as normal if ""for"" is something other than ""window"", don't process if ""event"" starts with ""onload "" or ""onload("" (case insensitive compare) then don't process otherwise process as normal wild oh yeah wait so i think the situation was this so if ""for"" is ""window"" and ""event"" does *not* start with ""onload"" you run the script? at the dawn of time we ignored 'for' and 'event' so <script for=""window"" event=""onclick""> would run immediately? that's pretty special even for the web :-P sorry arg, so many negatives so if it starts with ""onload "" or ""onload("", then run as normal otherwise don't process that makes more sense but only by a smidgen so let me try to restate it to make sure I understand i'd really hate to put this in the spec though i've been meaning to nuke all of this crap for ages, never got around to it basically, if it has ""for"" *and* ""event"", then don't process *except* well, maybe WebKit's recent behavior is good enough - I dunno we just refuse to run anything with a ""for"" attribute if it's for=""window"" event=""onload(..."" or for=""window"" event=""onload ..."" ok what if it's just event=""onload"" with no paren or space? event="""" in IE can have ()s? o_O getting back to dynamically inserted scripts - here is where we added support: http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/9105 the bug is sadly internal bug we had numerous separate reports and developer requests since 2005, we have not had a bug that we diagnosed as being due to lack of order guarantee we later added load events for script elements: http://bugzilla.opendarwin.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5812 sorry, antique URL, you want https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5812",0

"a little question. in samba 3.x, when acting as pdc, do I need to have the logon path directive set to use roaming profiles? cause when I activate it, I get problems in windows. deactivate it, and the roaming profile works :\ my smb.conf for reference: <a href=""http://pastebin.ca/84851"">http://pastebin.ca/84851</a> weirdguy: what sort of problem do you have when you specify logon path? the client complains that it cant access the directory. weirdguy: and when you take it away.. what.. you just get no errors? I'm not sure that means its working. :) I get no errors.. and when I login with an user that has no previous profile stored in the server, the profile gets copied to the server when I logout.... weirdguy: anyhow, do a net use [a-z]: \\server\profiles on the windows box when logged in as a user \\server\profiles\user that is or the first, and the cd to the user dir.. and make sure you can read/write there if you take away the logon path it probably goes to the default of storing the profile in \homes\user\profile well, storing it under \homes\user\profile is good enough for me.. I just thought it was a bit weird to have that problem when logon path was set to \\server\user\profile.. and taking away the setting would make it put the files on the place I had defined... oh, I didnt look to closely at your smb.conf.. let me see _bitwise: in the smb.conf , I had removed the logon path setting.. that's the config that is currently working hmm, probably because you didn't have logon path :P if you want the profile to be stored in their homedirectory, you dont need to set logon path. that's the default see smb.conf(5) thx for the help , _bitwise de nada",0

Try /msg 4e63bbbffbcaf12608512401eaf11240 help scribe: e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 Topic: font-weight JD: In Cambridge we discussed bolder and lighter http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Tracker/issues/61 JD: It's a frustrating discussion, because of platform restrictions and lack of [cool] fonts JD: m+ (Japanese Open Source font) supports seven weights JD: 300 is equal to 200, 700 is equal to 600 JD: the issue in Cambridge was, given a line of text, given font fallback, multiple fonts can be used, then with nested elements with bolder, bolder, bolder, what should happen? CL: if you have a value already from an inherited context [... scribe missed ...] JD: where do you make the determination? JD: am I simply doing incremental steps of boldness or am I picking a font somehow and resolving the calculation at that point JD: of course the computed value comes in because it becomes funny DB: computed value can be 1) just a weight, 2) a pair of a weight and a number (number indicates times bolder written), 3) a weight plus a sequence of bolder/lighter steps SZ: when I say bolder and there are at least two weights in the font, I'm at the lighter of the two, I'm in a span that has a bolder, what should I expect? JD: euh, the bolder one SZ: it changes the number JD: BB proposed that you calculate a number based on the first font JD: the reason I brought up m+ is that there a number of gotchas with that JD: [missed] (Chris demonstrates some tests with ZalamanderCaps, a font with six weights) JD: if I say my body is 400 and I go to bolder JD: then you get 500, but then if you have a fallback font that has 400 and 700 you end up with 400 again JD: in this world, most fonts are 400/700 JD: I suggest we simply iterate through 100/400/700/900 for bolder/lighter HL: you can still use the absolute values if you really know things HL: this is just for the relatives CL: good point SZ: there are some 400/600 JD: I don't know of those, Japan has some 300/600 not so worried if its just the relatives. As long as higher quality results are not excluded JD: will still do the right thing HL: is the rounding defined? JD: yes HL: sounds reasonable JD: you get a consistent computed value wights in zalamander: ultrabold 800 bold 700 semibold 600 regular 400 light 300 extralight 250 SZ: IH's distinction goes away, right? DB: yes DB: this probably addresses the use case for bolder/lighter better and is much simpler [humming] critical difference is that you can do bolder/lighter without knowing the current font family JD: I will write this out DB: I think you might want to ping DH directly DB: I think Opera might do that as well DB: they basically maintain a sequence of +ses and -ses [discussion about IH's test and the complexity of the model] CL: might be useful to make duplicate test with different fonts JD: In some of the edits made by the other editors they wanted to allow non-multiples of a 100 agree that weights cannot be compared over families JD: 600 in one font vs 650 in another font is not noticable s/noticable/consistent/ SZ: the relatives are not for people who care about typography [scribe notes they are also for default style of elements] DB: I don't think authors know the difference between bold and bolder or think bolder is more bold than bold [joke about adding boldest] JD: I made a post to www-style JD: in response to ""CSS font selection is broken"" (not exact subject) JD: the way things work on Linux/Windows is unfortunate http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2009Mar/0041.html [people are quoting from the e-mail] Thomas Phinney's arguments are good but his conclusion does not follow from his arguments [JD is performing a recap of the e-mail on the whiteboard] jd: in opentype, font family can have platform-specific variations - localisations, and windows/mac variations so the semantics are platform dependent ... hence Arial and Arial Black, two families on windows and one family on mac ... thus MS have a ""preferred family"" but CSS only allows selecting by slope, width and weight s/slope/style/ ... opentype 1.5 has wwsfamily wpf has a hash table classification of *known* fonts (only) DB: If I and JD disagree JD is right JD: there is a possibility in the future that Microsoft might ship fonts with broader families CL: everyone with a photoshop will have a certain set of fonts and communities around photoshop will start using them, etc. fails SZ: [missed] JD: the first point is that we don't define what a given name maps to on a given platform JD: on any given platform there will be plethora of different font formats JD: but we can give guidelines JD: for OT/TT we suggest that you do certain things SZ: the important part for me was that it's an abstraction, not a direct JD: we can suggest a path to goodness JD: I disagree with your second point JD: with the exception of optical size I don't see a lot of variations even within Adobe families that somehow would be helped with this JD: I'm a little sceptical even with optical size SZ: I understand... in some magical way... JD: the flipside of this, after the break I want to talk about the specifics of the @font-face mechanism and local faces JD: via that mechanism you can separate things out... ... it's going to be so rare; there will be font foundries that define fonts with their own set of axis ... ... the only thing that we can do is that we put in some kind of string that we can somehow match against the style name ... which is suicide ... localization issues, semantics could change, accidental matching ... using local with the default name is a much more robust mechanism ... let's take a break and then talk about @font-face HL: comments from MS? SG: no, I don't work with the Windows team on fonts, but with IE SG: and there's a huge back compat",0

"69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: when you say and i think we should have a principle that says that existing practices, where harmless or beneficial, should be adopted, rather than trying to swim upstream for purely theoretical reasons -- I think there are already two design principles that cover that: support existing content and save the cowpaths the trick is to get folks to agree with the basic premise underlying all I think that if we acknowledge that browser makers have to render existing material, and that spec organizations have two roles: ca4923f2d198f6bbff488e483461b3bc: i was saying that as a suggestion to split the ""pave the cowpaths"" principle in three providing guidance to browser makers so that authors don't need to write code four times AND providing guidance to authors so that best practices start to emerge then there may not be any disagreement i was just talking about the author side I think most of why people object to supporting existing content is that it sounds like bad grammar is being mandated -- it isn't the browser folks just want to preserve what already exists without breaking it yeah is aware :-) a good authoring document from W3C could just resolve the dispute (it seems to me -- completely naively of course) yeah... we just need someone to volunteer to write it we do have volunteers to write authoring guidelines / tutorials based on the specs, though none who have actually started yet ca4923f2d198f6bbff488e483461b3bc: see, I don't believe in bad grammar I would never have thought you to have :) oh ick that sounds awful Murray seems to have accepted Dan's nomination and he seems to be qualified imho there is only one qualification that is needed and that is having already started :-) it is just a matter of getting the ball rolling and convincing folks it is rolling in the right direction If there is confidence that bad grammar is not being mandated, then alot of the suspicion may evaporate I know it isn't being mandated -- you guys tell us it isn't -- Maybe a good solid promisory note that it won't be will be enough s/isory/issory/ I have a sense that the WG will eventually sort of coalesce but that the oddball harmonics of third generation dispute will reverberate for a few years i thought we'd already resolved that particular issue actually That would be nice -- I thought people just got sidetracked by new stuff and by Dan's prohibition on the topic for a while it seemed to me that the same issue rather mutated into a new guise maybe i guess we'll see when the group does real work That is clearly what Dan is encouraging It's amazing that WHATWG is still getting work done -- my hat is off to all of you the competition isn't going to stand still while we do our little w3c politicking... we can't afford to not get work done The people who have been doing WHATWG for a long time do have a big advantage over the rest of us -- I got knee deep in some document.write test cases I was trying to figure out during the last week and found myself getting confused about specs and browsers and what a test case would show the internets are hard they are - - mind bogglingly so well -- it is late in my part of the country -- so will have to sign off -- take a look at the dash-stroke cases I put in WHATWG -- some are quite cute Writing tests is a good way to hit all the complex bits that are specified or implemented wrongly :-) nn dashed strokes are kind of useful for charts, if that becomes a more popular use for <canvas> it might be worth speccing them Not good for minimising confusion, though but detailing how the dash pattern works is a pain yeah i imagine dashes will be a v3 or v4 feature",0

"Okay I will. Hi! finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind Did she at least help with your body? If not then that's really sad people think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy No you are just destined to be moppy the clown You're not fucking them hard enough Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify Can you help me occupy my brain? Well you bring new meaning to the term ""stranger"" but I guess so I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind That's what I tell people most of the time o-o Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry Happiness I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal Oh so you're an emo Poet? Happiness I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal ..a shit one? I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too late iam dissapointet you should know this song ... Probably but pop culture isn't one of my strong points I'm going to go ahead and say goodbye its not a pop song black sabbath man black sabbath Cool and isn't pop culture a term for things like... i don't know I give up but you know black sabbath? Yeah a bit I never really got into music if that is even believable wow why? I suppose as a child people would tell me ""that song is shit"" so I never thought to create an opinion and explore types of music in fear of rejection from my peers? o-o Although I did buy some beats headphones so I should listen to more music BEST HEADPHONES EVER fuck headphones, music has got to be loud out of speakers Although think about this Beats headphones cost Â£300 and I don't listen to music how smart am I? Good point but these headphones can deafen a person with ease i have a 1000 watt speaker So a big music fan huh? yeah ...wow that makes me sound really stupid considering this conversation has been all about music XD; you should listen to judas priest motÃ¶rhead ac/dc thin lizzy twisted sister and so on but i have to go now so start listening to music I don't know if you are going to get headphones Beats are good since they get rid of all sound around you so it's just the music with purest of sound where you can head every beat and note.. i found a lot of new things in the songs i have with them Fine I'll look those up Thanks bye",0

"4c681049601b3c374f1d2c0077c99049: Ola! d6e292711389fc8c3d399cd640fc8a40, welcome!!! (guy who redesigned the w3c html5 author spec to look pretty n all that ) oooh, i wanted to talk to that guy! Thanks for the intro. Your tweet prompted me to log here d6e292711389fc8c3d399cd640fc8a40: do you mind if i reuse your style sheet (probably with modifications) on the whatwg site also? 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: I'd love you to do that. I was thinking that I should ""licence it"" for uses by the w3c and whatwg only yesterdayâÃÃ®Just to be clear of my intentions sweet dunno when i'll get to it but http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=11229 is tracking this particular issue my plan is to make the ""author view"" version of the whatwg spec use your style sheet see that bug and the reddit comment linked to from there for more details if you would like i can set it up so that it grabs the style sheet from somewhere you control, so you can update it in realtime I've got some additional fixes for colour and some bugs in opera that brucel raisedâÃÂ¶ (either on your site, or i can give you an account on whatwg.org) 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: I think that would be best, so that I can have some form of active deployment Right now the process is that I build it here, work against it, commit it to a repo, Mike merges from git to cvs, then *magic* d6e292711389fc8c3d399cd640fc8a40: yeah 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: I'm happy for an account on whatwgâÃÂ¶ d6e292711389fc8c3d399cd640fc8a40: w3c kinda frown on linking out to other sites, but there's no problem with linking out on whatwg.org so if your site can handle the (pretty small) load, that's fine by me so it's entirely up to you (if you would rather an account on whatwg.org, let me know your preferred username) that new ""too slow"" alert seems like it's made the spec more sluggish 5220e4152ba2b190163b088bd6a9541d: i doubt it's the alert that's made it more sluggish, but it might just be bringing attention to it :-) seems fine now that it's gone it was struuuuuglng with it up 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: Tell you whatâÃÃ®Lets do whatwg.org, because of the cross domain issues that 4c681049601b3c374f1d2c0077c99049 raised with webfontsâÃÂ¶ 5220e4152ba2b190163b088bd6a9541d: oh while the alert is up it might be slow because the alert is semi-transparent position:fixed and your browser might not be good at scrolling that d6e292711389fc8c3d399cd640fc8a40: k, sounds good d6e292711389fc8c3d399cd640fc8a40: preferred username? and the infrastructure is already goingâÃÂ¶ 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: d6e292711389fc8c3d399cd640fc8a40' will do fine k do you prefer to work using scp, or do you prefer to edit things like on the host over ssh? edit things live, even 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: If I can build the spec locally just as easily as the author-spec, then I'd scp it. build the spec locally? 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: Yeah, on my machine Just to style against the HTML what are your inputs and outputs? (just trying to work out what exactly you mean by ""build"") Oh, sorryâÃÂ¶ (there's a number of steps involved from the original source file all the way to what's on the w3c site, and the whatwg site has a slightly different branch of that process) I'd checkout the source of the entire spec, run the build command, then write my stylesheets against the HTML product. (so it's not entirely clear what you mean!) 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: Ah sureâÃÃ®Well with the author specâÃÂ¶ https://github.com d6e292711389fc8c3d399cd640fc8a40/html5forAuthors I built it using the Makefile that sideshowbarker uses aah i think that's a part of the process that doesn't happen for the whatwg copy hmm i guess what you mean by ""spec source"" is actually the post-processed single-page version of the spec what i consider my primary ""output"" :-) aka http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/ 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: Yes right :) 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: How about you throw what you have at me, I'll work it outâÃÂ¶ otherwise I'm sure that I can ask i'm just trying to work out how where to put things so your output is a bunch of HTML, CSS, and JS files, right? Yep is your work environment unix? or rather: Mac, but uyes yes * hm so here's what i figure the long-term situation might be instead of the current situation where we have a multipage copy that has radio buttons to switch style sheets, we have the author version of the spec actually be on its own domain, like authors.whatwg.org/html/ or some such with you in charge of authors.whatwg.org and then each time i regen the script, i can ping a CGI script on authors.whatwg.org that regens the author version from the full version what do you think? 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: sounds good to me! and we don't need the cgi scripts in the author version, so that solves that issue (the cgi scripts being the ones that show the current status of each section, and the bug filing tool) awesome let's get that set up so when you say authors spec, you mean web developer edition I always found that terminology ""web authors"" so ambiguous yeah yeah, it's a historical thing we talk in terms of authors, users, implementors, and spec editors but authors these days are really web devs what should the subdomain be rather than authors.whatwg.org? help.whatwg.org? webdevs.whatwg.org? guides.whatwg.org? note that the whatwg.org/c spec (the ""complete"" spec) contains more than just HTML (more than the whatwg.org/html spec) hence my suggestion that we put this guide in something.whatwg.org/html, so that later we can add guides for other things too like web workers, web storage, etc sureâÃÂ¶ 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: It sounds a bit official, but don't you think something like developers.whatwg.org would be good? After all, web developers are the target d6e292711389fc8c3d399cd640fc8a40: wfm hm, turns out we have a help.whatwg.org already, looks like it's run by a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 wakes up and a syntax.whatwg.org, i wonder what that was for I'm just to the first one to have put anything up on help.whatwg.org I guess I'm happy if anybody wants to put whatever else they'd like there http://forums.whatwg.org/viewtopic.php?t=11 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: I think syntax.whatwg.org might have been intended for hosting that relaxng and datatype library for the validator ""I found the DTD file for the HTML 5.0 Draft. <http://syntax.whatwg.org/sgml/html5core+wf2/pre1/dtd>"" *the relaxng schemas a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: That was http://syntax.whattf.org/, I thought ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: yeah syntax.whatwg.org is empty as far as i can tell i guess i'll delete it for now can always add it back if it's actually useful",0

"I assume from b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 's latest tweet that he must be working on a sanitzer ah sweet, I got another patch landed in V8 source http://code.google.com/p/v8/source/detail?r=5893 a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: just planning at this point ok a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: since the sanitizer isn't targeted to Firefox 4, all Firefox 4 blockers get service first yeah, I can imagine b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: Have you looked at what the html5lib sanitizer does? It has some (crazy, regexp based) CSS filtering b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: I haven't I was planning on providing an interface for pluggable CSS sanitizers Which you need in order to remove scripts so that the Gecko version could use the existing Gecko CSS sanitizer and the Java version could use something else At least if you target browsers that can run scripts from CSS yeah, using a CSS sanitizer is part of the requirements at some point, I think I will need to learn which SVG attributes are defined in terms of CSS in such a way that they can carry dangerous payloads b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: whoa. html5lib is much more liberal with allowed protocols than I had expected otoh, there are fewer acceptable CSS properties than I expected also, Semantics MathML isn't allowed b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: (I have not been much involved with this part of the library) In particular the list of allowed stuff mainly came from Sam and Jacques hmm. so it sanitizer between the tokenizer and the tree builder instead of sanitizing after the tree builder when it's known if something is an HTML, SVG or MathML element I think it predates foreignContent |Foreign Content"" s/|/""/ (that is, althought there is support for SVG elements, that was based on Sam's experimental liberal XHTML parser. Although presumably that assigned namespaceness in treebuilder too) for blog comments and such, it might be useful to have a feature for normalizing all the ""semantic"" aliases of <i> to <i> for simpler styling hmm. does http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/parsing.html#determining-the-character-encoding ever care about /mode/ being ""charset""? it seems to me it only cares about it being ""pragma"" vs not oh. it does care so <meta charset=""UTF-8"" content=""text/html; charset=UTF-8""> doesn't sniff to UTF-8 but <meta content=""text/html; charset=UTF-8"" charset=""UTF-8""> does looks like spec bug to me... I hate it when I find spec bugs when I just want to implement and be done b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: how does it not sniff to utf-8? ""If the attribute's name is ""charset"": If charset is still set to null, let charset be the encoding corresponding to the attribute's value, and set mode to ""charset""."" cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0: the content attribute sets mode again, this time to pragma cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0: when content="""" comes after charset="""" b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: oh, i missed step 9 b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: yeah, spec bug wonders is document.written meta charset has an effect *if b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: In Gecko, it doesn't b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: but Hixie WONTFIXed the spec bug: http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=10803 I didn't change Gecko according to WONTFIXing Ah. I had a feeling it was something like that Any idea what webkit or IE do? b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: testing other browsers and reopening certain bugs is on my todo list whoa. the ""in head"" handling of the charset attribute seems bogus as far as the UTF-16 part goes sigh. the difference between the spec and Gecko is larger than I thought oh. UTF-16 gets handled later",0

"hsivonen: no, nobody seems willing to make that kind of claim on record :-( all right, this is probably a FAQ, but what's up with accesskey? it's mentioned repeatedly in wf2 but not at all in html5 haven't yet worked out wtf to do with it it's so fundamentally broken in so many ways... documenting current practice isn't sufficient? i understand the extent of its brokenness currnet practice varies dramatically and is fundamentally broken that has never stopped you before... 6579a25fc8e60d2ff7dfb590bb79042f: the difference is that for accesskey i don't know how to fix it :-( i see argh! http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms535181.aspx ""This example uses the address element to italicize text."" just shoot me http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#area does not define the nohref attribute what does the nohref attribute do? described here: http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/objects.html#adef-nohref but what does the nohref attribute do? (there are few UA conformance requirements in the HTML4 spec, and none for nohref, so it's not a good source of information for what things in HTML do) i understand i believe it's a way of marking that the <area>'s lack of an @href attribute is intentional so it does nothing? i.e. for validation checking firefox code hang on (and if we can't trust that the lack of an href attribute is intentional, why can we trust that the presence of a nohref attribute _is_?) firefox does precisely nothing with it no changes in behavior, nothing ok then http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/dhtml/reference/properties/nohref.asp says ""Sets or retrieves whether clicks in this region cause action."" which is slightly tantalizing msdn is wrong. :-) i tested it a lot, couldn't find that the attribute did anything, so i dropped it it seemed singularily pointless. aha http://www.idocs.com/tags/images/_AREA_NOHREF.html it is for dead zones in shaped <area>s see the idocs link yes but how does that differ from the lack of an href attribute? hacking the idocs test case reveals that there is no difference i have discovered html's most useless attribute pretty much or, more likely, rediscovered hi all...offering some experience re: 512 scanning for encoding. GRDDL parsing seems to be depending on profile for each microformat...and if one defines each official and draft uF, 512 is rapidly approached. might be something to work out with the GRDDL/hGRDDL WG folks 2nd concern: if multiple media and/or alternate stylesheet PI's are used, 512 can become a concern, too",0

"ping: 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e hey hey 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e - do you know, or know someone who knows, or know somewhere I can find out information about youtube.com/html5 ? what information? HTTP requisites not sure what you mean I'm getting 403 on my experimental build of webkit odd so presumably there are requisite headers 403 for the video file? yes and it works for regular webkit? how weird have you dumped the two network traffic sessions and compared them? i don't see why there'd be anything like that this is a different multimedia backend i'd recommend cracking out tcpdump and comparing them hmm, ok my thought is it's probably either a cookie it wants, or a missing refferer header my backend passes on neither at the moment anyway, I just thought you might have seen some documents floating around I could consult :) oh you almost certainly need the opt-in cookie yeah, unfortunately the webkit interface for media is somewhat broken in this respect. The backend is only passed a URL to the media file. seriously, i'd recommend using tcpdump to see what the working UA is sending it could be something obvious a13dd189d82538a3cf8f8e47d3b133a5: we do want to eventually fix the networking to go through WebKit's http stick - just tricky to beat both WebKit and relevant media engines into shape a13dd189d82538a3cf8f8e47d3b133a5: I think Referer or Cookie is a likely candidate a13dd189d82538a3cf8f8e47d3b133a5: if you find the differences, one easy way to see which is making the difference could be to use curl or wget with custom headers unfortunately I'm on linux atm, and HTML5 media support is in chrome (but not chromium) afaik which leaves me with nothing to compare against but a massive wget hack could work :P there's no official Chrome for Linux yet? wait, WebKit/Gtk has video support - does that not work? (or is that what you are working on now?) I'm working on WebKit/Qt you could check if WebKit/Gtk can handle YouTube, that might be the easiest point of reference (though of course you'd need a GStreamer module that does H.264...) yeah.. I have that I'll investigate :) also, it looks like there is an official chrome for linux now dear lord, the GTK version explicitly spoofs its user agent for movies.apple.com",0

"Element.replaceElement() Does that seem somewhat appropriate? I think a shorter name is somewhat risky and not in the same style as Node.cloneNode() replaceElement sounds like you should pass in an element node i dunno, i think rename is fine It is much more than renaming though But yeah, I guess it is clearer cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0, you don't think rename() would conflict with custom properties people have out there? cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0, that was a problem anyway with some of the forms extensions hahaha edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: http://tweakers.net/nieuws/76475/firefox-vertrouwt-digid-toch-na-verzoek-nederlandse-overheid.html ja zag het mooie overheid hebben we eh , wth firefox 7 beta now gives me sec_error_ocsp_unknown_cert for bol.com's https. Worked yesterday. o_O *digs into certificates* Mmm, Chrome 14 works still one month for Gears of War 3 it better be awesome That's odd, I don't have the option selected that specifies to treat a certificate as invalid if the OCSP cannot be reached. Yet it does fail on FF 7, unless I am misunderstanding what is going wrong here. Wonder if I trip a bug here or not. edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: No idea tbh. Just finished DXHR last night, nice story and pretty good game overall. And yet Aurora doesn't fail. Eh? is not a big fan of RPGs edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: You're more the FPSer? OK, now I totally don't get it anymore. I temporarily disable OCSP checking. Log into that site, log out again. Make sure I am back on the normal http homepage. Enable OCSP checks again and log in again. No complaints this time. OCSP checks get cached or something? platform and some FPS games I guess edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: From what I heard so far, and I deal with a lot of gamedevs, it seems to be quite ok, worthy successor in the series. though nowadays I only play games every month or so and occasionally a couple of times a year a little longer if there's a good game edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: possible. renameElement is fine also oops, that was double :) edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: Given I am trying to move into the gamedev industry, I play too much ;) var is_khtml = (navigator.vendor == 'KDE' || ( document.childNodes && !document.all && !navigator.taintEnabled ));",0

"yassine: I do now. jasonb, i created a filter yassine: What's going on? which gets a parameter from the request ok. And? than calls an other url gets a file process the file data Is the URL to get the file a request to the same Tomcat instance? depending on it contents i do set the an attribute on the session like this : anHttpServletRequest.getSession().setAttribute(""username"",username); wenn the user submits a second request i check if the username == null and if his parameter==null so he is not authenticated but for some reasons the username is alway null parameter in the session? oh. I think I know what you mean. no Okay, I may know what your problem is. You have to send a session cookie when you authenticate your user. When using container-managed auth (you aren't), the container sends the browser a cookie when the user authenticates successfully, and the cookie contains the session ID. Then, on the second request, the browser sends the cookie back, and that is how the container matches the second request up with the first one... and the session. So, for your custom auth, your Filter must send the browser a session cookie similiarly. If you don't send a session cookie, then the browser's second request isn't associated with anything, and a call to getSession() actually creates a brand new session object. (which isn't what you want to do) In that case, anything you try to get out of the new (empty) session is just null. Does that solve your mystery? :) i think so Good. one question when i seta cookie with the session id created so the session remains available and when the user requests a new request i check that cookie and see the session objekt that match for my data ? Yes. It has been a long time since I wrote my own custom authentication, but I seem to remember that if you use the exact same session cookie name that Tomcat uses, Tomcat will do that part for you. But, I'm not sure. Your Filter can keep a HashMap of session references, and when the request comes in you could look up the session reference by the session ID string.. ahh like they do in the SingleSigneOn Vlave of tomcat ? ui have seen such technic in the code Maybe wait i have the part here one sec",0

"Oh, wow. Very clever, 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, in your CSS usage in the Hebrew example in the lists module. (Setting tbody { display:table; float:left; } to get a multicolumn table. 1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb: heh Only problem is that it breaks the display of thead, at least in Chrome. Hm. Oh, because you display:none'd it. Never mind. i do that quite often i display:noned the thead in the atob table recently too but for that one i used the multicol module to get columns not the tbody trick and for some reason it's not rendering right dunno what's up with that Not surprised that multicol and tables work oddly together. yeah there's all kinds of bugs with it multicol+abspos+table+:hover breaks in the named char ref table too It's pretty undefined, I think, what multicol is supposed to do with other layout modes inside of it. There's nothing sensible about a multicol containing a flexbox, frex. I think it needs to work with the same mechanism as multipage (which is also undefined ;_;). is kyle simpson here by any chance?",0

"wow, f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220, you're right, XHTML5 *is* a widely used term... about 1/10th as widely used as XHTML2 b65a1668d3f56352ebf6e4735afeb424: I wasn't making a comparison of how widely each are used, it makes no difference that ""XHTML2"" is used more than ""XHTML5"" then why did you make the argument? because it is a widely used term. just because A is more widely used than B, doesn't mean B isn't widely used the only reason I see for HTML5's XML serialization to be called XHTML (as far as I can tell) is to attempt to undermine the efforts of XHTML2 why isn't HTML5/XML just as good, for example? so you're ignoring the fact that XHTML5 is much close to XHTML1, than XHTML2 is. If only one is to retain the name, it should be the one that is closer to XHTML1. however, I couldn't care less if XHTML2 retains it's name. XHTML2 is irrelevant f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220, I can read, and I've read that argument about 20 times now well, then why are you still debating? it's clear that that's your opinion, but remember, ""opinions don't matter"", right? I'm not debating, I'm pointing out that you aren't making very good arguments I have no investment in XHTML2 at all, myself that XHTML2 is irrelevant is my opinion, but that XHTML5 is closer to XHTML1 than XHTML2 is, is a fact (which I already supplied evidence for) on a syntactic level, perhaps but not in spirit XHTML2's effort doesn't need any undermining they seem to be handling that fine by themselves ok, then why are you getting in a pissing contest about the name? I think it's fine for both to keep their current name I'm not the one who started asking the other group to change I think both using the XHTML1 namespace URI is a bigger problem, but it would be a problem for XHTML2 even if XHTML5 didn't exist if XHTML2 is so doomed, why would you even want XHTML5 to be associated with the name? or, in other news, why not just play nice and use a different name? - the normal name so far for an XML version of HTML has been XHTML, there doesn't seem to be any deep need to change it - why doesn't XHTML2 WG play nice and use a different name? (not that I care if they do, but they are the ones who seem to think different names are important) I think the XHTML2 WG passing a resolution that the HTML WG should not use a particular name is not a very friendly way to start the discussion I believe that the discussion was started by the WHATWG appropriating the W3C name XHTML, don't you agree? or am I mischaracterizing the situation? WHATWG used the name ""Web Apps 1.0"" although unofficially people referred to it as HTML5 and XHTML5 now it is a W3C spec maintained by the HTML WG which has officially resolved to name it HTML5, but has not picked an official name for the XHTML serialization although popular and sensible proposals include XHTML 5 and XHTML 1.5 that wasn't my question, 139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 I think it's a mischaracterization to say ""the discussion was started by the WHATWG appropriating the W3C name XHTML"" which was in fact your question how is it a mischaracterization? f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 stated that the term XHTML5 has been used for 3 years.... either it has been or it hasn't and, in fact, it has WHATWG didn't name anything XHTML5, random people called it that, now the WG is considering making it official you should run for office :) no one told XHTML2 WG what they should or shouldn't name their spec both groups will be defining languages evolved from XHTML 1 I am sure arguments could be made why one side has more right to the name than the other I think sharing is just fine I think they were chartered to work on the XHTML spec, right? I think it's not a very friendly way to start the discussion by appropriating the name of a language that they were chartered to define they are chartered to ""continue the XHTML2 work"" I didn't know they were chartered to define XHTML5 I don't think it says that in their charter I don't see a problem with both languages being named XHTML N for different values of N you can spin it howver you like, maciej, but I'll say again, the only reason I can see for the HTML WG (and the WHATWG) to use the term XHTML5 is to sow confusion and undermine the XHTML2 WG and I suspect you think the same thing I'd be fine with XHTML 1.5 as a name if it made people happy (makes it more clear that it is related to the XHTML 1.x family of languages, not XHTML2) but I don't think it would make people happy you know it wouldn't, and you know why I personally don't care what the XHTML2 WG does and I wish they would leave us alone we don't go to their mailing list to start turf wars or pissing matches there's an easy way to do that: stop stepping on their toes... there are plenty of perfectly good acronyms out there it could certainly reduce confusion if they didn't use ""H"", ""T"", ""M"" and ""L"" in that order in their name but like I said, I'm just a spectator here since it may lead people to think their language is suitable for use as an on-the-wire format, or would work in browsers there has been no real evidence for such confusion presented yet but I don't think it's a big problem for them to keep the XHTML2 name ah, yes, ""evidence"" that's starting to sound like a dirty word I actually don't know why XHTML 1.5 would be unacceptable either - it lets XHTML2 keep the privilege of the larger number and the appearance of the more radically forward-looking language define evidence, please... and do avoid using the word ""evident"" because it's clear that's not what you mean 139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884, because there would be a name clash through iterations either way I mean, I guess it is ok for the XHTML2 WG to make a polite request to change the name of the XML serialization of our language, but I also think it is ok for us to say ""no"" to that evidence for confusion would be things like forum posts, emails, blog posts, etc. that ask questions like what's the difference between XHTML2 and XHTML5, and saying I don't understand something, where such statements arise from the similarity in names (assuming either language survives more than a couple decades, which I personally doubt) arguments could be made both ways why one has more or less right to claim their language is a successor to XHTML but arguing such things is a waste of time let's just be nice and share lol I honestly think you're a good guy, 139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884, but I don't think you're being straightforward here f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220, I've been at a meeting where there was, in fact, great confusion about the relationship of XHTML2 and XHTML5 it was a large meeting of mostly technical people sample argument: XHTML5 will likely get served as application/xhtml+xml on the public web as a final format, XHTML2 likely won't (unless carefully restricted to an XHTML5 or XHTML1-compatible subset, or using trickery like client-side XSLT to transform to an actual end delivery format) seems like the thing that will be served with the XHTML MIME type should be named XHTML (this is not to disparage the potential value of XHTML2 as a back-end authoring format) you can see how arguments along these lines could easily turn into a mean-spirited dick size flamewar",0

"What Molly says is very non-specific. It seems to invite commenters to stir it but it doesn't look like something that could be addressed productively. :-( I guess molly expresses worries. Some of these worries are driven by the fact that from HTML 4 specification to HTML 5 Specification, there is nothing in common. I still believe that the specification should have been split and we are paying the price of misunderstanding now when I say nothing in document, I'm talking about the documents s/nothing in document/nothing in common/ my usual dislexya I wish that WASP would help at least to federate authors and web designers. It would really help in the flow of the discussion. the only issue I see about WASP is that there is somehow too much cross-polinization. http://www.webstandards.org/about/members/ I remember when I participated to the creation of W3Quebec, advocacy group in Canada, I have decided to stay behind and not actively participate, to guarantee their independence. f47636673b14c54021a69dc06f6a19fb: I expect this to be hard for the WaSP: http://annevankesteren.nl/2007/04/html-red-pill f47636673b14c54021a69dc06f6a19fb: that is, they have prominent members who have advocated XHTML (de facto as text/html) (this sort of thing also leads to bizarre statements about ""Web standards"" on public-html, when the list is about defining Web standards) b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: yes but the list public-html is a mix of communities. With a very black and white picture, I would say, people implementing browsers and people using the markup. People using the markup are left apart for now, because HTML 5 specification as it is now is not usable for them. This morning, I took a copy of HTML 5 put it in authoring tool and started to remove things which were not directly for authors by removing big chunk of sections even doing that you end up with a document which is still not readable for authors. :) authors are part of the business of HTML. f47636673b14c54021a69dc06f6a19fb: I wouldn't even expect the spec to be usable for authors. I'd expect an O'Reilly book to rehash it for authors. the other part of the community (implementers, browser developers) have a hard time to accept this :) It will come little by little each community will do a step and at a point they will meet b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: that's exactly the demonstration ;) of what I was saying f47636673b14c54021a69dc06f6a19fb: I know. :-) f47636673b14c54021a69dc06f6a19fb: there's a point in there, though :) f47636673b14c54021a69dc06f6a19fb: for the spec to be precise enough for implementors and spec lawyers who advice authors, the spec needs to say things that look like unusable distractions to casual authors who want to read a tutorial f47636673b14c54021a69dc06f6a19fb: for example, the ""writing html"" section isn't really for authors. it is for author-side spec lawyers who can't/won't step through the algorithms yep agreed splitting the spec. :)",0

"http://www.bernzilla.com/item.php?id=875 oops replies to a mail without noticing it was sent to a mailing list whistles innocently and moves on to the next mail cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0: hey, finally someone who agrees with me! 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: yeah :) actually, i feel ""dirty"" too, i just think that it's not really harmful and authors changing their documents to insert div tags around images to conform to html5 are wasting their time i was talking to citoyen yesterday about this the only reason we have <div> is to allow custom widgets to be made i can't work out how to make it hard to abuse it if you make it hard to abuse div, people will abuse something else... :) (like table) <table>, <br>, and <div> are the main ones i'm worried about being abused <table> is being dealt with by education moderately successfully, even <br> is a tough one. i don't know how to not use <br> in a forum that accepts bbcode. people want to be able to make one, two, three, many line-breaks. fwiw, they also aren't going to mark up headings in any other manner than pressing the BOLD button and hitting enter (well, i guess a heading bbcode tag could be introduced -- that was an aside) the contents of forum postings are equivalent to wysiwyg editor output yeah i don't know how to handle those either it's not trivial the <meta generator> idea didn't go down well indeed about div and what it means... perhaps when it contains block-level content, it means nothing, and when it contains inline-level content, it means a thematic group or it always means a thematic group isn't that what <section> is? section affects the document outline, div doesn't i suppose i could buy your block vs inline semantics definition but when it contains blocks, it really means nothing, imho that, btw, is why i didn't want it containing inlines in the first place yeah if <div>-containing-inline is ""thematic group"", what's the difference between <div> and <p>? maybe i should just bite the bullet and make them equivalent in the spec <div>-containing-inline and <p>, i mean not <div>-containing-block i would be ok with that 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: somehow your scripts converted ""<code title=""attr-style-scoped"">scoped</code> attribute"" to ""<code title=attr-style-scoped><a href=""#scoped""></a></code>"" i probably edited the file while the thing was being generated i'm using bert's script to do the cross-references it runs on cgi.w3.org and takes three years per generetion ok :) and i have to do two each time i do a checkin (one for the w3.org version and one for the whatwg.org version) oh yep so that's six years :-P yeah, looks like i changed the file while i was generating it d'oh oh well fixed i wonder why i used a different technique for <xmp> as for the other CDATA elements 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: If div may be used for custom widgets (as it is in the wild), then treating div with inline children like p would presumably break paragraph to paragraph navigation. Is your current view that div-as-custom-widget be conforming, non-conforming but specified, or non-conforming and unspecified? 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: Having said that, it might be worth defining special parsing for p containing certain children, such as blockquote. (where stuff which can go into print paragraphs cannot go into text/html paragraphs) *special parsing for div containing certain children, sorry ef6f2287bae00ba79475fbf56c2b6fee: conforming but discouraged in favour of things like xbl2 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: How about processing WAI-ARIA attributes for such widgets then? which category would that fall into? btw examples of paragraph-by-paragraph navigation include: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2266 and http://images.apple.com/accessibility/voiceover/pdf/VoiceOverKeyboard_Color_v2.pdf and http://www.rnib.org.uk/xpedio/groups/public/documents/PublicWebsite/public_rnib003398.hcsp and http://www.gwmicro.com/window-eyes/manual/html/index.html?appendix_a_1.htm (though note this doesn't necessarily equal navigation by <p>) e.g. ""Window-Eyes defines paragraphs as any collection of elements that contain blank space both above and below the collection, regardless of whether that collection contains text, or any other element."" i don't really understand any of your questions :-) we already have, e.g., <li> defined to be a paragraph i don't understand what the processing of WAI-ARIA would get us (they're woefully underdefined and redundant with most of what's already in HTML anyway) 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: It seems to be a fundamental premise of WAI-ARIA to prefer native widgets where available (which seems to be exactly the same as the position you're suggesting WHATWG adopt). WAI-ARIA is clearly not redundant for custom widgets since they aren't in HTML. 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: They don't seem to be so underdefined that Mozilla and AT can't implement them. Does WHATWG have an alternative proposal for accessifying such widgets in current browsers and AT? WAI-ARIA is redundant for most (all?) the widgets it supports, as they are all defined in HTML5 as far as I can tell. 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: WAI-ARIA doesn't support just a set of widgets but also a set of properties and states. Can Dojo use HTML5 widgets in current UAs and have them look as ""nice"" as their existing widget set? Mozilla doesn't seem to support some of the more basic HTML5 widgets yet ... e.g. slider. HTML5 doesn't define how to do widgets with custom look or behavior (in itself) they are underdefined, for example it is not at all clear what it would mean if you had a document with a wairole:treeitem as a child of a waitrole:checkbox or some such WAI-ARIA and HTML5 both define new technologies, and therefore don't work in legacy UA ATs 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: Legacy UA AT != current UA ATs by ""Legacy UA AT"" i mean the currento nes ones as opposed to the ones that support the technologies in question 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: The breakage is not the same. You cannot write Dojo widgets in HTML5 and get them to look ""nice"" in IE. But you can write Dojo widgets and get them to look ""nice"" in all modern browsers, but also be accessible in Mozilla (and thus to major AT). i disagree, but that's not really important With which bit? The cannot or the can? that you can't use the HTML5 elements and have them look good in IE it's just a matter of using the right elements and then replacing them in script with whatever you want to replace them with but anyway, i'm more interested in the long term solution to this which is, imho, to use xbl2 and html5 (or just CSS styling of form controls for simple cases if there's ever sufficiently interoperable support for that) yeah imho the wai-aria/role stuff is a distraction that is merely slowing the adoption rate for the long-term solutions wai-aria/role aren't scalable, and are far too complicated to implement by most authors well, the long-term solutions are much more complex in terms of required browser engineering to deploy right 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: I doubt accessibility is the major driver for XBL2 adoption, so I doubt that's the case. the complexity is placed in the UAs, rather than the authors 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: Custom widgets are too complicated to implement by most authors full stop. (XBL2 is way too complex) (that's the right way to do it, it reduces the total implementation cost to the human race) anyway, gotta go, meeting bbl",0

Im not a female if thats what you seek when people realise im NOT here for sex talks they disconnect straight away well same for me thats good 98% people here are horny males who cant just masturbate in front of porn to reduce their horniness before talking to people in a standart way whatttt? yeah you're right Im not saying I cant be horny mmm hmmm. did you know when you walk beside someone you'll eventually syncronise your steps. but I keep it for myself maybe I dont know its okay we all get confused. all the time meh oh well meh? wish I could find a girlfriend before 20 yeah at least you're someone i can have a kinda normal conversation with. im not a guy by the way how old are you? im 19 nice you may flee I know I might sound associal and nerdish I dont care hmm im 14. na you're too old for me what too old, you mean you're looking for a bf? its okay nerdish people are people who em. well. em. well everything has its pros and cons You might already have one anyway nope nope im concentrating on my exams like normal 14 year olds normality is ... define normality ummm wait i'll get the dictionary. my vocab sucks normalness means average or typical. something expected of something so thats what you are like a normal orange is orange. cos you expect an orange to be orange. and i am normal. normalness is reassuring because it makes us feel like we belong to society and fit in it doesn't necessarily mean you will follow it yup. you cant say you're abnormal it sometimes just means you're different. yes but you will probably find a boyfriend easily naaa im not pretty or super cool like most normal girls. I never had a girlfriend, so sometimes I feel like I dont fit in the portrait although I know this all results for societal pressure and lack of self-confidence with girls normal people find me wierd cos i have a thing for paper clip necklaces well thats a taste dont worry about it my friend's brother is 20 and has never had a girlfriend. and girls are also irritating. most of them cant get why soccer is awesome its awesome for some people, for others not Its a matter of taste and culture+personnal education mmm hmmm interesting view are you american? Im a canadian from quebec oh. oops pretty far off. im singaporean i see how is it there? mmm warm. humid. i dont think you actually know where singapore is? its near malaysia on some sort of island if i remember well YESS you know singapore exists! most people think its near the easter islands i see yeahh gets kinda annoying when people say ""singapore??? where's that?"" haha have you been here? I can understand that nope just know from geography classes what do you learn about us? low population? sort of high rather it is a city state right? of 8 million inhabitants? I might be wrong yeah i think its only 2 million. or something like that. dont really pay attention in class aw well anyway Ill be going hmm? twas nice talking with you really? thanks you too youre welcome good luck bye then 20 year old candadian guy haha , see you 14 yo singaporean girl :P",0

"Evening I'm trying to locate information on what I believe is an addon for tomcat. Its called Evolution. We have an internal website running it and the gentleman that set it up left the company and either didn't have notes/docs or took them with him :( Has anyone heard of this? Darin_1: you really think it's an tomcat-specific addon, or is it ""just"" a webapp? That could be but I'm not sure.... Darin_1: does it reside below /webapps? [$TOMCAT/webapps/..] I believe so. I'm at home now so I can't login to the server and double check did you already examine it's [evolution, regardless where you find anything] directory-structure? perhaps you'll find some readme, or there's e.g. ""webapps/classes/<package-path>"" -- where <package-path> might give a hint to the origins domain. Darin_1: mmh to answer your question: sorry, i've never heard about it ;-) It seems like a lot of stuff was purged. Many empty directories Well, thanks for trying :) I suspect he purged all the docs so he would get a new contract later but who knows <shrug> hu? they guy that set up the whole site. Its an internal website so relatively static and nobody else messed with it Darin_1: if it's still working, i assume you'll find some traces [what it is, what it's name is, where it's from ..] somewhere in it's structure. The part I was actually looking at was the file with the connection information to our database server so it could be updated. I inherited a mess of cross-connected web servers and sql servers didn't have much time to explore all of what was there. There was almost 600 M of files including the content :( you're somewhat familiar with tomcat? datasources? tomcat no. I'm actually the network admin (vb/access programmer in the past) had the contractors to do stuff with teh web sites hmm ic. so it's all a bit poking in the fog. I know :( that is exactly how I feel Darin_1: i'm sorry, but it's 2am here now, and i'll leave the office now ;-) ahh, night then :) sounds like UK timezone Darin_1: it might help you to grep for the database's name. i'd begin with that in $TOMCAT/conf, as there's some chance that the app uses a tomcat-configured datasource. Darin_1: even 2h later my problem is I know apache but not tomcat I wish people would have written a more descriptive reason when an exception is thrown.",0

"alright. pop quiz time. When IE9 renders things identical to Chrome and Firefox, except for some reason ajax loading on the same domain isn't happening, and it shows no errors in its debugger, how do you find out what's wrong. to be more specific, *certain* ajax loads. most work, but the most pivotal (of course) does nothing. is it console logging time? 0de37da1d654c10aed33d7b7347b8e3b: it's time to to wave chicken in the moonlight and stick needles to steveb voodoo doll he's the main reason I read little microsoft news. getting at least a normal looking spokesperson and sitting back in an office like the rich bastard you are, is the right thing to do. although that doesn't quite help in problem solving of course. know of any extended IE9 debug tools? what do you guys use for RSS reading? google.com/reader and I read a lot :) google reader is nice that it works on every device and correctly marks posts readed still and I use it on mobile, desktop and tablet how is the tablet version? it's same as mobile for iPad you can get various apps with reader integration I have been using MobileRSS the biggest benefit is that it cheats and pulls the whole article w/ads into the reader when possible without ads, that's it some kind of magic to extract #content div from the article 0acb83f1a9cfc48f061ff5555e61c6bf: I use Reeder for iPad. It's amazing :) From your 255 subscriptions, over the last 30 days you read 1,561 items, clicked 4 items, starred 2 items, and emailed 0 items. Since January 8, 2008 you have read a total of 300,000+ items.

"hmm. Why does V.nu have unused floating point datatypes? Maybe because the spec used to have floats until they got changed to doubles? has the spec changed back and forth as far as exponent allowability on input type=number goes? I can't believe the validator has been wrong for 4 years with the correct code in the codebase as dead code can't be bothered to do full version control archeology research I'm rather shocked by the state of float handling in the validator it looks like I almost fixed this stuff in 2007 and then forgot to take all the remaining steps it's also possible that Hixie has had something too crazy in the spec at a critical moment seriously, it's 2011 and we still get stuff like this in a spec: http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria/complete#valuetype_number why does the PFWG ask me to state if I'm commenting on behalf of an organization and if the org is a W3C group, Member org or other? Isn't http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria/complete#typemapping the more relevant definition of ""number""? b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: Because a comment from some W3C member could turn into a vote against the spec at PR at the AC level? b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: What would you rather the abstract model defined a number to be? http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria/complete#valuetype_number seems plausible as a definition of what XML Schema calls the value space, although then the problem is the value space can't be represented by the lexical representations listed in http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria/complete#typemapping (since they only do finite decimal numbers, not all real numbers) but that's being a bit picky Filed http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/comments/details?comment_id=357 b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: I think that section just defines the abstract ARIA model, not specific to any syntax. ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: OK. so the spec fails by not linking to that section a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554: I see. I don't like this abstract stuff. b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: That subsubsection says ""These are generic types for states and properties, but do not define specific representation. See State and Property Attribute Processing for details on how these values are expressed and handled in host languages."" which links to http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria/complete#state_property_processing which links to http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria/complete#typemapping ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: ok. (though it says it's non-normative) well, evidently, this is a readability failure b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: Well, really, it's no worse from an abstraction POV than HTML5, which only clearly defines the element definitions as abstract in one or two easy to miss places The undefinedness of how to lexically represent e.g. the aria-valuenow property with value 1/3 isn't great, but at least it's trying, whereas HTML5 only defines the mathematical concept of numbers as the consequence of a 140-word paragraph (and then defines a parsing algorithm that gives a different result) huh.

"I don't suppose that there is a nice Qt way to find the amount of used and free disk space? I say ""Qt way"" because it would be nice to be platform-independent. marcusU: not that I know of Yeah, I'm seeing that that's the case from my Googling. for posix systems, maybe statvfs I was thinking of writing something like KDiskFree but using pie charts instead. hm, sorta like win98 IIRC Yeah. I really think that a pie chart is more easier to see visually than a bar chart. yep I'm just starting actually trying to write some stuff in C++ with Qt. So I was looking for something easier like that, but unfortunately, it looks like a hard project since I don't know Windows well enough. Plus I'm annoyed that KDiskFree has ugly colors that are not configurable. or just make it non-windows for now and worry about that later unless you'er using windows as we spea of course *speak Yeah. I guess so. I was just trying to be a ""good boy"" and write platform-independent code. I only occasionally use Windows at home. speaking of Windows, I still think they need to give Qt a face-lift for Vista. probably prudent to do that but how can you expect a 200 men team to accomodate all the innovations in three different platforms? you are asking 200 developers to chase all the innovations going on at Apple, Microsoft and GNOME/KDE even just small things.. it's mostly OK on vista won't it be easier to take the conservative route with Qt? Just use it for backend business logic? but it'd be interesting if they had aero wizards, command links, etc and use the native GUI for everything GUI? the new UI stuff in vista.. My graphics system can't run the aero stuff. :-( hm, old graphics card? Yeah. But I don't need transparent windows or games. The only thing I do is use Linux/Qt/KDE and play DVDs. redear: maybe.. but it isn't really designed for being a back-end, not that it can't be. ... it's a start most frameworks involves something like Qt, plus your own framework Does Qt use native Windows widgets on Windows? no, they don't use native widgets after that i guess you can work in peace on your business logic blockd: I read something that they use some kind of HID renderer on OS X. what's a good c++ backend framework for serving the business logic then? something that provides you a platform agnostic DB/memory/file/etc/etc if not Qt marcusU: on mac and windows they use native API's for rendering, but they're not the ""native"" widgets AFAIK that's why the mac and winxp style are only available on the respective platofrms *styles I just looked, they use HIThemes -- whatever that is. just the main thing that sticks out on vista is the progress bar.. the vista UX guidelines are a little shady and contradictory, but progress bars seem to have been replaced with ""meters"" now solid progress bars and they have an animation effect, sort of like a bubble of light.. er something Meters? I used to like the kind of dial-like widgets I got on lots of NeXTSTEP apps. Apple didn't keep those. :-( When I turn on progress bar animation in KDE, I get nauseated! meters is their term.. think like a green thermometer instead of a winxp progress bar (Not cuz it looks bad -- because it makes me motion sick) let me find a screen shot while I'm complaining, a proper search field might be nice too :-) I'm not going to replace my Matrox G550 card untiil I absolutely have to. Proper search field? on Mac, the rounded text field with the magnifying glass icon.. and on vista a line edit without a border and then a flat tooltip beside that with a magifying glass (looks better than it sounds) It looks fine in KDE. <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/UxGuide/UXGuide/Controls/ProgressBars.asp"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/UxGuide/UXGuide/Controls/ProgressBars.asp</a> But I'm kind of confused. scroll down to the part about ""meters"", they seem to have replaced all progress bars with those :\ I think the UXGuide is out of date, which isn't surprising confused about what? blockd: From the page you showed me, I see several different widgets that show the concept of something being partly completely. They different in their appearance for no obvious reason. It's all a confusing mess. But Windows users are used to have every app have a different widget style. yeah, just search to the second mention of ""meters"", that's what all progress bars actually seem to be like even for apps compiled for WinXP, so they wouldn't have had any way of adjusting for vista And I don't understand why they don't want the progress bar to show the percent complete. better yet, search for ""Use progress bars only for progress. Use meters to indicate a percentage that is not related to progress."" well, it probably just wouldn't look good Windows has never good very good. I don't think that the distinction between meters and progress bars is a useful one. Vista isn't so bad looking, despite its other numerous problems nope, in fact as far as I can tell they've actually replaced progress bars with meters despite what those docs say.. I haven't seen a ""progress bar"" in vista except in Qt now :\ just meteres *meters I think that percentage is a very useful item and should be shown. it's useful, but just philosophizing, can't a person tell just as well from looking at it? Some people like the percentage. Some people like the absolute number. Why not give them both, such as ""500 out of 1000 files (50%) copied""? And if it's really a slow operation, it's nice to watch the update 501 files copied, 502, 503, etc. but that's not related to percentage at that point What? I don't understand. AFAIK you're talking about a really large scale, so the progress bar won't update often.. I'm usually copying little files. And my disks are fast. Okay. I'm getting late. I'm going to bed. It's nice to chat with you, blockd. yeah, it's late here too. Anyway, I don't mean to make this into a huge issue. It's fine with me. See you. pointlessly correcting my previous sentence many lines up, toolbutton, not tooltip",0

I see now :) there can be multiple ports afaik can a SharedWorker know when a port disconnects (because a tab/window was closed)? I found a bunch of mailing list posts about onclose but I don't see anything in the current spec there's a suggestion of using onunload but this doesn't work everywhere wow. the poster thread just goes on and on f9edf56d68cb1988bda824218c70ee5d, I think best would be emailing the list thanks",0

"stiv2k: wireless is basically limted to three walls stiv2k: and less is better so, no you can't see completely through a bunch of houses unless they all have windows that line up, and are always open hahaha what if you had a crazy powerful antenna of some sort sure it won't be legal do you have site to site LOS from the roof ridge ? then you could go farther but a lot of shit i do is illegal also, you can be legal with quite big antennas as long as its P2P stiv2k: true you could, but walls and trees are good at limiting your options DrDT: muh? What crack are you smoking? its against FCC heh eiggirC: the FCC crack, DrDT: Depending on yor locality its ""total power output must not exceed XXX"" DrDT: there's absolutely nothing about protocols its transmission power eiggirC: obviously not, read it. lol :-) hm 18:17 < DrDT> also, you can be legal with quite big antennas as long as its P2P well my friend lives 2 houses down or did you mean point to point? thaqt's obviously what i mean i wonder if a pair of simple cantennas pointed at eachother would work what other p2p would apply to antenna output power? DrDT: well its still total transmisison power, regardless if its across the room or across the road or suburb or whatever 2 houses isn't that far... eiggirC: obviously DrDT: yeah actually read ""p2p"" and thought filesharing and that tx power can be quite higher if it's p2p instead of p2mp well, lurk moar dammit DrDT: -grin- as long as its legal you're safe. it says you can go up to 48dbm if it's p2p and you reduce your amp output by whatever amount you add to the antenna... IIRC 1dbm less amp output for each 3dbm antenna gain which means, again IIRC (I'm tired) that you're legal with a p2p setup with each end at 24dbm amp output and 24dbi antenna gain which is a huge-ass amount of power for the wireless we do you could easily punch through a few houses with that stiv2k: you could try cantennas, but I'd say you might as well go to 19dbi (or 24dbi, but they're huge) dishes to get lots of signal yeah but i dont wanna spend hundreds of dollars for that i made a cantenna 19s aren't that much i can pick up a bunch of networks but none of them are strong enough to connect to it seems you can't trust the gain on a home-made cantenna much hehe im just experimenting esp. if you're not experienced at doing it uh ""pick up"" in kismet or netstumbler? kismet oops netstumbler i mean ok, if you said Kismet I'd say don't consider that a proof of your antenna kismet is receive-only, so if your antenna had a high SWR (bad) you wouldn't notice it much. no, i don't like kismet i've used it though but i used netstumbler in this case but netstumbler broadcasts, so if you can pick up stuff it means you're at least transmitting not-bad. DrDT: in windows wireless zero thing...the highest signal strength i got was 1 bar and it wouldn't connect stiv2k: that measure is useless. i have heard somewhere that it doesnt matter how poweful your antenna is, it's card-specific if the AP isn't powerful enough to hear your packets, it wont work or something along those lines that would be wrong, antenna is very important, and you get tx gain as well as RX someone in this channel said that stiv2k: good, having a good chipset is important yeah i spent 70 bucks on it i hope i can make it worth it alright, so theoretically, would it be possible to build/buy an antenna to connect to a friend's network without having to have them put an antenna on their side stiv2k: possibly, but that's hard DrDT: while it is atheros, its weak it says like 65mw on the datasheet DrDT: like i said they live only 2 houses down i want to use as little equip. as possible stiv2k: that's because you got a cheapy one, that's a usual power for cheapy atheros $70 is cheapy? heh and if you're going through a few houses it'll be unlikely to happen without an antenna at their end stiv2k: yes i wanna mess around with more homemad antennas before i move onto commercial ones 2 houses you can probably do with only good quip. at your end, as long as their cards/antennas aren't complete crap. i believe its a linksys WRT54g a good PC card costs 130$US (ubiquiti atheros 300mw) jesus stiv2k: WRT54Gs have broadcom chipsets which aren't great but you can try it i didn't know the chipset mattered you should expect it... rf design is hard what's a good router? apparently other than the radio the wrt54g series are good, except for the vxworks ones I consider D-link the least crappy cheap router brand, although they've had a few crap ones, and Linksys is pretty close. either way, I need sleep we should have ""which is a good router/radio/how do I do this short link"" questions in the FAQ if we don't have already since they're quite common anyways, g'nite guys <a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=257625110103098179&q=rat"">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=257625110103098179&q=rat</a>",0

"69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, thanks ""just"" use BEEP lol wut if the beep advocates can write a DOM API spec for BEEP, adapt BEEP to work in the browser same-origin security model, and convince browser vendors to implement it, I have no objections to it but i think it would still be good to have a simple protocol like websocket as well :-) (not necessarily websocket itself) yeah, that's basically my issue with the entire discussion I almost wrote a message asking maciej whether WebSocket prevented the design he was adovocating i figure we can add an optional second argument to the constructor, and have that be part of the handshake -- and if the server doesn't send back the same string, abort with a suitable error code. WebSocket-Subprotocol: or something maybe we can even get the IANA to give us a registry for subprotocol types I think rfc3117 is my favorite until it goes off into BEEP land it's like the finale of battlestar galactica no spoilers please... :) for those of us in way behind tv land i'll forever be anticipating rfc3117 references in msg now s/msg/bsg fortunately there is nothing overt! hehe mmm, this hybi list is intensely unproductive amazing I just don't get it 1) solve the smallest problem you possibly can 2) declare victory 3) ??? 4) Profit! why do anything else? 14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4: a lot of the people on that list are already on step 4 and are wondering why we are talking about changing their steps 1 and 2 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, are you being sympathetic to me or them? neither :-) i believe that a lot of the pushback we're getting is because there is already a thriving business around these involved protocols good point maybe we should ask for a new WG ""The good thing about reinventing the wheel is that you can get a round one."" I rather like that quote and it was about XML vs JSON i'm reading rfc3117 again -- it feels like when you hit section 3.4 it suddenly goes from being a useful overview of the state of affairs to being an exercise in second system syndrome. yeah but it's great because it is 8 years old and still a useful overview",0

"c6768aee3a877e80e1d4fb102f75a4bb: I believe that's not possible You'd have to have lots of canvases, or one big canvas which you copy all the fragments onto ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: thanks for the answer... What's the best (= most performant) way to realise ~1000 scopes that get updated each second? ist currently using images where the src get's modified - and that's extremely slow What kind of image is being shown in each? and how large are they? a little icon, 4x4 pixel, png, no transparency each scope has 8 of them Hmm, I find it hard to visualise what you mean <div class=""hbeat""> <img src=""1.png"" /><img src=""1.png"" /><img src=""0.png"" /><img src=""0.png"" /><img src=""1.png"" /><img src=""1.png"" /><img src=""0.png"" /><img src=""1.png"" /><img src=""dot.png"" /> </div> 1.png and 0.png either show a peak or a plain line currently a JavaScript function is called every second to move the src attribute from each img to its right neighbour and depending on other data the left most img is then set to 0.png or 1.png => it looks like a scope that's flowing to the right (it looks a bit like the CPU graph in the MS Windows task manager, the direction of the flow is just opposite) Sounds like doing it with canvas and drawing lines (rather than using images) should have much lower overhead Not sure how well it'd work if you have a thousand to update per second, though (Drawing them all onto one big canvas would probably be faster than drawing lots of little ones, I'd expect) ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: yes, that's my reasoning. One big canvas, only one translate and 1000 little draws per second resulting in only one redraw should be very lightweight well, I guess that I'll have to stay not optimal for now... can't think of a better solution",0

"Heya Hola was up? where ya from? USa U? nice :) England cool I wanna visit England one day see stonehenge and the castles and Parliament go all over Europe :) I wanna go on a roadtrip across the US Rt. 66 baby! best way to see the US Drive along from Chicago to LA :D totally so, am i talking to a lady or a sir? <-- is from Chicago I'm a guy oh okay and yourself? I'm a mermaid, with legs. Well, it's nice to meet you but I have to ask a question I'm listening and I hope that you will not think it impolite of me but if you are a mermaid with legs, does that mean that you are a fish on the top half? mhm go on if so, it will be very hard to go anywhere without a steady stream of water over your gills ahhh, but no, i converted from mermaid TO human, so now i have a human body BUT i can breathe underwater, neat huh? ahhh makes more sense that way easier to get around Plus, you get all the benefits of being able to live on both land AND water! mhm :) You can't go wrong! I also find this strangely arousing, but perhaps it is just because I'm a freak. :) Sorry. Didn't mean to make the convo weird. Nahhh, you're not a freak I am, in a way, most people judge me for wanting to be human, but oh well :\ Although now I'm sitting here wondering if it would be considered inter-species dating or some sort of bestiality. LOL! I would not consider you a freak. I always wondered how merfolk procreated. I assumed it was like fish where the female lays the eggs and then the males come along and fertilize them. Which just takes all of the fun completely out of the act. Yeah, you pretty much got it right... u still there? yeah I see now why you wanted to be human more fun. yeah, but being a mermaid is fun in a way that you never get cold and the guys are always shirtless :) true but we can go shirtless on the surface as well. And you have the possibility of seeing other areas without any coverings as well. :) Plus, It's not so much fun for us guys Hmm, you made me giggle aloud by saying that :) I mean you mermaids wear bikini tops we don't get to see you shirtless! true, true :) Which part made you giggle? the possibility of seeing us without other coverings? yes, that part LOL so how old are you, my little water lover alas, I'm only 16 going on 17 :\ what about you? so would that make me 17 going on 18? LOL i guess so :) and how long have you been in your human form? wow, it's been a while actually, since i was 4 wow so you really don't remember having a fin or anything, do you? i remember that my tail was blue-ish green, i think... <--- is thinking you actually sound hot and more sane than over half of the people I meet on here. really? the sane part that is yep not sure if that is sad or not hm, okay... thanks anyway :) so, what's up? not too much just not able to fall asleep ** on originally came on to watch some porn so I am no here uhuh, you still planing on doing that? but thought this would be more fun perhaps you never know hmm, can i help with the boredom? if I meet more sane people like you whom I can have interesting conversations with, then I guess I will not need to watch any porn. mhm... and how would you like to help with the boredom? hmmm, a kiss? *kisses your cheek* :: blushes:: :) :: gives you a kiss back :: hmm, you'd make me blush :) *moves closer* what now? :) perhaps I could finally see what you mermaids keep hiding under those seashell and coconut bikinis? hmmm, maybe so, maybe so ;) what would I need to do? well, like with any other girl, you would need to charm me :) kisses you again but we just met I am not sure what you like mmm, that is true I don't even know what you look like. :( I'm short, dissapointing huh? I like short what else? long-ish wavy brown hair mmm not your stereotype 'blonde' mermaid that's fine. I still like it! i'm not fat at all but not skinny either.i have curves :) and I stand by my earlier comment about you sounding hot. good. always good to know that when we get wild I'm not going to break you. err, and if it helps, my bra size is 34c :) mmmmm very sexy <-- <-- is 5'8"" 165Lbs brown hair baby blue eyes mine are green/hazel :) and you sound hot ) 6Â¾"" long if you wanted to know LOL thanks :) Sounds like we could have lots of fun together :) you still there or did I loose you? alas, it seems my mermaid has swam away. good night sweet, hot, mermaid!

"hey Hey, I'm Ronaldo, 18 and from Hawaii. (Perverts and vacuous bimbos please fuck off) lol I'm not a perv or vacuous bimbo but I do have a question to ask of you oh first off aloha~ second Ok do you know any other methods for separating molecules besides electrophoresis and chromatography? I don't study science :| People who do suck no offense lol it's not my major it's a general ed requirement for my college :P that sucks my major is history so pointless history is important you have to understand your past to make sense of your present and why things are happening today why we are in wars and poverty i didn't say history wasn't important it's not pointless you shouldn't bash things you don't know about wtf are you talking about then what is? i was referring to them making you do history i mean science are you brain damaged? Stranger: it's not my major Stranger: it's a general ed requirement for my college You: that sucks Stranger: :P You: so pointless lol Geez oh haha sorry I didn't get it in that order :P yeah thats worrying I love history ou: my major is history Stranger: that sucks Stranger: so pointless I'm gonna do Middle Eastern studies at college in fact I got it like that wow that's awesome what sparked your interest in that? Oh I see I wanna work in the CIA and I already know three languages fluently, so I figure if I get another high worth language like Arabic and some relevant middle east knowledge i might have a good chance also I love the history of the middle east that's cool I know arabic nice I'm middle eastern :P You know Arabic coolio What are you? exactly? I'm from egypt Do you consider yourself Arabian? I know thats a bit of an issue in the middle east yeah lol You do? But you're not, you're Egyptian what's your take on the war in iraq? Egyptians didn't consider themselves as ""Arabian"" until the government started pushing the agenda in like the 1930s I speak arabic, I consider myself arabian I think its sad people consider themselves Arabian when they are from a countries which have far richer histories than Arabia. The Arabians were just some tribesmen before Mohammed came along, Arabia can't compare to the histories of Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Lebanon etc hey half of my family comes from egypt, my dad's side that's why I say I'm from there, other half is from yemen yemenis are considered the epitome of arabians haha Yeah, Yemen sucks but so does Saudi do you personally know people from yemen? and have you ever been to yemen? if not, you're being really prejudice The country sucks, they can't keeo control of their country all the terrorists are training there that's just what the media is showing don't believe what you hear from bias news stations SHOOOOR",0

"hi there is there any way to build, say, a ""wifi signal concentrator""? I mean, something that passively brings signal from a given direction (for example, with a yagi) and reflects that signal in the area of my powerbook? This idea comes from lacks of a plug for wifi antennas on my powerbook... I'd also like to discuss other solutions to allow my powerbook to get more signal like a black hole that curves space and light ? SuD: ah ah ah actually a flat reflector would be ok, like a mirror made of plain steel or such SuD: where do I attach that reflector?! SuD: ok, let me explain the difference from another viewpoint. SuD: suppose I am wardriving around with my PC laptop: my yagi is attached to the SMA connector I've on the Orinoco. What if I need to do something *similar* with my powerbook? Since I cannot attach the SMA connector (since powerbook has no PCMCIA nor SMA connectors), I've thought to build something that, say, diffuse the signal coming from the yagi around the powerbook 1-2dB would be enough apple laptops usually have MC mini connectors other things may work or not i once read about a passive repeater made of 2 antennas joint by coaxial cable SuD: powerbook 12'' doesn't seem to have connectors have you looked at the minipci slot ? SuD: no, I don't know if I have such a slot there it is, afaik or it used to be or perhaps you had to put keyboard off SuD: lemme check a friend had a pbok 12"" or similar SuD: great SuD: yes, someone already made it <a href=""http://www.seattlewireless.net/pipermail/talk/2004-September/016177.html"">http://www.seattlewireless.net/pipermail/talk/2004-September/016177.html</a> iirc there was no way of leaving a permanent pigtail without piercing better buy a card with antenna SuD: I've a pb 12'': don't hava PCMCIA neither my friend, so he buyed a prism2.x based usb card with sma connector :) SuD: interesting SuD: which manufacturer? senao irrc SuD: got a match or zcom maybe a white one SuD: nice SuD: I found SuD: that fucking site is unbrowseable!

"hmm. now internationalization and accessibility & ethics are at odds: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2008Feb/0030.html i've given up reading through his replies wonders how fast his note about <object> will cause a stirr wonders if edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e did it on purpose well, I did want to point out that his point of view has caused issues in the past, but I didn't want to say too much I think it's rather well put, but probably only if you agree with my line of thought edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: well, gotta love a situation where one way leads to getting accused of breaking accessibility and the other would lead to accusations of breaking internationalization It's hard for me to see what his real issue is. That some browsers are still broken? edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: so I gather from his feedback ok, so I did read the important parts of course, it is well-known that there are older versions of IE still out there that don't support IDN but IE7 supports IDN, right? guess first sentence/last sentence, first paragraph/last paragraph, might be applicable to e-mail too b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9, yeah they also experimented with IDN for e-mail I believe edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: I think you're probably right about aria-* and <object>, at least from the pov of author confusion. I can't imagine any spec that forces us to deal with <label for=""a"">foo</label> <span id=""b"">bar</span> <input id=""a"" aria-labelledby=""b""> is going to be easy for authors to understand ""well, if the OBJECT model failed, it was due to lousy implementation decisions"" Ouch: ""Some weeks ago you quoted an ISO standard I haven't heard of before for your definition of ""valid"".

"can't remember how to simplify logs does ln|x-2| - ln|x+2| = ln|(x-2)(x+2)| or not? is just being stupid No ln|(x-2)/(x+2)|, I think looks at marking scheme and sees he's made another mistake ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: That's still wrong because it's a modulo function, IIRC a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554: Oh, you mean |x-2| like abs(x-2) and not just fancy brackets? In that case you'd want to calculate separate solutions for x <= -2, -2 < x <= 2, and 2 < x I also realized I didn't actually need to simplify it ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: yes annevk: http://philip.html5.org/data/script-with-trailing-slash.txt fails to see how \frac{x^2}{x^2-4} = 1 + \frac{4}{x^2-4} sees now wonders how we're meant to realize that (x^2)/(x^2-4) = (x^2-4+4)/(x^2-4) = 1 + 4/(x^2-4) It's just a standard way of rearranging fractions :-) Try to add stuff to the top so it looks like the bottom, and then things cancel out nicely Yeah, I saw that It's just a question of how we are meant to realize that I guess we're meant to think that x = y + 4 and work out that y = x^2-4 You're meant to have done some maths in the past, so you can recognise that in this kind of case you can simplify by adding stuff to the top so it looks like the bottom :-) You see there's a 1, so you try to make a 1 on the left side too, and it just works out. :) It's just an instance of a/(a+b) = (a+b-b)/(a+b) = 1+b/(a+b), which is a simplification if b is simpler than a Uh, 1-b/(a+b) ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: Yeah, sure, but I haven't done maths in weeks :P finds it strange that the BBC iPlayer appears to have the rights to stream some movies but [this is wild speculation] not to display screenshots of them on the web site, so the poster frames are unrelated images of the principal actor (e.g. http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b009lt62/The_Magic_Roundabout/ and http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00gbjh8/Dances_with_Wolves/) annevk, oops, I meant: http://projectcerbera.com/!dev/whatwg-blog/ unrelatedly notices that a480104b0e570389c6f4284a88c7cd9d's latest blog post breaks Opera's feed reader, because Opera scrolls horizontally to the end of the ""java -classpath ..."" line and does not display horizontal scrollbars and so the rest of the post disappears off the left edge of the screen really threw himself a the hard end of stuff going straight into previous exam qustions jgraham, good to know. :) You mean you can break Opera with something as simple as a <pre>? a480104b0e570389c6f4284a88c7cd9d: It appears so a480104b0e570389c6f4284a88c7cd9d: (though it's only showing a single feed entry at a time, so you can only break your own and can't interfere with anyone else's) it seems Opera 9 uses ul { margin: 1em 0; } when a <ul> is inside a <dd> whereas Firefox and IE have a rule like dl ul { margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; } (Fx and IE are what I expected) 42e76c77af424a4350ab0e3e3f6f2ce9: Would you mind if I said I thought that blog design looked quite ugly? :-) Actually I think it's just the green that I don't like much, mainly the blockquotes If I remove the colours and indent them more then it looks better to me - the green box is just a bit weird Also the green horizontal lines are a kind of sickly colour - if I make them something like 2px #ddf then it makes me happier Other than that, it looks fine to me :-) ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c, I just copied the colours from the spec. feel free to put your own demos online jgraham, updated the table inspector UI demo: http://projectcerbera.com/!dev/table-inspector/new",0

"IâÃÃ´m doing a little mobile thing, and having trouble because there seems to be no way to get device ppi, which makes a big difference in how big stuff is on high-rez displays if fixed units like cm were calculated (and not derived from 96dpi) then theyâÃÃ´d be usable for detecting ppi without that or another way to detect IâÃÃ´m doomed to browser sniffing if viewport isnâÃÃ´t declared or Android actually supports SVG, which would be perfect for resolution-independent things on mobileâÃÂ¶ :-| is there a good reason why fixed units are derived not calculated? 1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f: That's actually a huge debate right now. 1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f: The physical units were supposed to be absolute 1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f: But that wasn't implemented in most browsers (mozilla's the exception, iirc it tries to get it right) 1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f: And now there are a lot of web pages that depend on the assumption that we're using 96dpip 1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f: The CSSWG currently has an issue open on whether to codify that assumption 1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f: And make physical units relative to px instead of making them absolute 1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f: What, exactly, are you needing absolute units for? hold on a secâÃÂ¶ back :) 3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d: doing something that IâÃÃ´d like to work on mobile phones and tablets. as Android doesnâÃÃ´t support SVG (facepalm) IâÃÃ´ll need some images but eg a usable button on various devices ranges massively; if viewport=""1"" an iPhone is 44px, an iPad is 36px and a Nexus One is 67px even worse with no viewport iPhone = 135px, ipad = 45px and nexus one = 112px. this is to make buttons that appear the same size hm Media Queries might help, but you're right, it's not ideal. knowing the ppi of the device we can make sure interface elements like buttons are the same size (ie usable). ideally this should be accessible via JS like screen width 1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f: Have you looked at the Media Queries spec? http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/ 1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f: It should let you query the resolution 1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f: as well as the viewport size we can get how many pixels the screen is, but given different ppi all bets are off. eg if the next iPhone is double the resolution as some ppl are rumoring, suddenly weâÃÃ´ve got twice the ppi in the same size screen. if we could get viewport size in physical dimensions thatâÃÃ´d be great, but again itâÃÃ´s calculated not actual You should be able to get the viewport size in physical dimensions If that's not the case, then WebKit has a bug I suppose either way, we should be defining the interaction of media queries and zooming features how can I get the viewport size in physical dimensions? instead of using px, use cm or something There's an example, @media screen and (min-width: 400px) and (max-width: 700px) You could do, e.g., @media screen and (min-width: 4in) and (max-width: 7in) IâÃÃ´ll have another look, but IâÃÃ´m under the impression that using cm we basically had the same problem that cm are calculated from a 96dpi base I'm sure that's the case for lengths in the document i only tried via JS tho, so will check @media it might not be the case with media queries if it is, report back here and I'll make sure the devs hear about it :) because that would pretty much defeat the whole purpose thanks :) honestly, desktop web devs donâÃÃ´t know how easy they have it ;-) hehe mobile = world of pain, even with smartphones 3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d: on iphone simulator the absolute length value is converted to px at 96dpi ok I'll take that back to the WG. Seems very wrong to me If you've got any other comments, let me know. I think I might go to bed soon, but I'll check the IRC logs tomorrow morning. I think px and cm and all should work the same everywhere, including in Media Queries getting a post written atm, but given 100mm @ 96dpi = 377.952755905512 pixels, Viewport set to 377 pixels returns red background on iPhone with 165dpi, and Viewport set to 378px returns white background with @media screen and (max-width: 100mm) { body {background-color: red;} } seems very wrong to me anyway if they would be different depending on context that's an issue, too but media queries aren't doing what they're supposed to do if you have no way of getting the measurements they were designed to allow finding out the actual size of the viewport is an important use case also, the reason that JS giving ppi would be better is eg using an iframe to add content to a different site at that stage IâÃÃ´m not sure if we can even use @media I'm not following 3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d: for this project, you have no idea how important :-| 1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f: what does an iframe have to do with anything? 1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f: I mean, how is it a different problem ? sorry, I meant to say that itâÃÃ´s not even a page that IâÃÃ´m serving itâÃÃ´s for a service that adds a popup to a client website (imported via JS that the client adds). actually donâÃÃ´t think weâÃÃ´re using iframe",0

Given how many people are implementing it, it'd be kind of nice if there was some interoperability, and currently there isn't much http://philip.html5.org/docs/rdfa/ - in how many ways is this horridly broken and/or rubbish? ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: you should join the xhtml2 wg and rewrite all their specs 73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46: That doesn't seem especially useful for all of them, only for ones that are being actively used :-p Also, that would be too much work and I'd get bored before then ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: you should join the xhtml2 wg and rewrite all their specs that are being actively used until you get bored The latter condition would only last for a few days, I expect wait, didn't you start doing this because you were bored? Yes and soon I'll think of something else to do instead (That occasion might coincidentally coincide with the release of the TF2 sniper/spy update) ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: should ""valid URL"" be ""valid URL that is an absolute URL""? 73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46: Apparently not, as far as I can tell from http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-syntax/ ok It talks about resolving all URIs, and doesn't say they have to be absolute even for xmlns - ""Note that it is generally considered a good idea not to use relative paths in namespace declarations, but since it is possible that an author may ignore this guidance, it is further possible that the URI obtained from a CURIE is relative. However, since all URIs must be resolved relative to [base] before being used to create triples, the use of relative paths should not have any effect on processing."" seems silly to allow relative urls imho :) the relative paths in xmlns thing was a huge war in XML land, about 9 nears ago... 73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46: I agree :-) ""seems silly to allow relative urls"" is a good summary :) This isn't just about xmlns, though yup It includes things like <div about=""#me""> which I suppose you do want to allow relative URLs for but re xml, this did blow up. http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xml-uri/ http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xml-uri/2000May/ (...1700 messages in two months) I guess it's impossible to require anything of xmlns values, but requiring CURIEs to be absolute (after prefix processing) seems sane yup c8418bd17d6b1d70bf83c9f1c1664266: Only 1700? plus a few offlist i'm sure :) public-html had 1773 in *one* month :-) i consider rdfa with curies to be about as fragile as Javascript ... but without the built-in ""aw crap it doesn't work, what did I screw up?"" corrective that comes with separating .js usage from .js declarations ...so i think we need some utilities that replace that part of the lifecycle. ""aww crap it doesn't work in google/yahoo"" might operate the same, if their indexes updated in real time or there were better checkers... Or just an HTML validator? Hmm, someone needs to invent a real-time search engine indexer update protocol there are so many ways of making technically valid stuff that's still not v useful but yeah, integration with normal validation ideally Maybe you could set up an <event-source> server that the indexers connect to, so you can immediately send them all your updates http://www.sitemaps.org/ is sorta related, but i guess those sitemaps are just periodically polled What kinds of problems would still be technically valid? Typos in namespace URIs is the obvious one, I suppose using an unfashionable property or old style URI yeah (I'm assuming the validator would be clever enough to detect references to undeclared prefixes etc) eg. if someone validates using http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.0/Creator I'd like an easy way for them to learn that http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.0/creator is more widely used, and http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/creator even more widely used (similar things hold for microformat idioms, since different constructs become fashionable over time, or are consumed by different apps) (Quite a few of the errors in http://philip.html5.org/data/rdf-namespace-status.txt are just plain typos - people find these things unusually tricky) rdf-namespace-status.txt is cool i had a script somewhere that tried to extract from dns/whois the time left for each popular domain was quite fiddly as i recall, maybe there's a better library out there to try somewhere whois+grep? :-) Hmm, I guess they're not a very consistent format xmlns.com appears to have its whois information in YAML (via Gandi) whois+grep --- yeah exactly what i was doing initially then i think i found some perl api yaml, cool hadn't seen that so one issue is figuring out from the domain ""xxx.yyy.zzz.aaa.bbb.ccc"" which one to look up Hmm, good point foo.co.uk you look up foo.co.uk foo.co.com you look up co.com ... http://publicsuffix.org/ seems too much like hard work yeah that's the site i was just thinking of i guess you can crawl down and look 'em all up What did you want that data for? i'd like to make a ""health check"" site for namespaces, ... so people have some sense of QA before they commit to using one I guess most people would leave it until the last minute before renewing their registration, and it's hard to tell the difference between that and an abandoned domain 'cos it's all well and good being decentralised, but not if it's going to leave holes in the data in 10 years time cos someone's random experiment accidentally got worldwide use last minute - yeah, also i'm told some registrars (eg. in Germany) don't let you register lots of years You could solve that problem by putting the RDF schema in a data: URL and use that as the namespace, instead of http:// so for eg dbpedia.org seemed to be perillously close to expiration, but the owner/admin had it on some rolling auto-debit arrangement heh, that'll really help with our consiseness problem :) Then you could define that namespace URI as an entity in an external DTD and import that into your document and use the entity reference which would avoid verbosity Then anyone publishing a vocabulary can put a DTD containing their schema data: URI onto their server The advantage is that you can move it onto a different host without changing the namespace that your data uses heh The disadvantage is that it's clearly a stupid idea how could the schema reference the properties defined within it? btw http://prefetch.net/code/domain-check looks handy I guess it could still reference them with ""#"" If it wants to reference anything in another schema, it can just import that schema's DTD it's mad but worth writing up! Also it ties in nicely to the discussion on the WHATWG list about having browsers download external DTDs gotta run (eats...)",0

"lyken, you evil :) how do i import an eclipse project in netbeans? kasbah, i guess there is an import project funtion you can use i guess so too, but i can't find it i dont have nb here running so im not sure where exactly i think under File -> somthin ? no kasbah, maybe you need to install other modules kasbah, you defenity need to i can create new projects and open netbeans projects ... but i can't import eclipse projects there if you are using the default NB so you should the import module does not come with NB hmm, i want to test netbeans ... my first start of NB today :P kasbah, and the Collaborative developemnt module too which is one of the reasons why i really enjoyed using NB kasbah, tonight when im at home we can try collaborative developemnt its really coooooool eh, no, i'm going to the ifa tomorow in the morning so i'm going sleep early today eh, reverse uml creation is funny :P kasbah, you work with UML ? yassinework: not really why not ? yassinework: because this is one thing i still need to learn ;) unfortunately the uml creation in NB is in the enterprise pack :/ kasbah, use DIA its 100% GPL i do this at least for the ER models dia can that too and if you want you can even generates your sql script from dia depending on your target db huh? hmm, can i also create uml from java and visa verse? Dia is small and simple. But, Netbeans is probably more featureful and nicer for UML diagramming your Java code. jasonb: but Netbeans entprise pack is expensive I have not yet used the enterprise pack to generate diagrams (for lack of time to try it), but I'd like to. hi jasonb hi yassinework good morning there :) kasbah: No, the UML stuff is free. kasbah, with dia yes uml <-> java the uml stuff is in the enterprise pack, isn't it? yassinework: hmm, i have take a closer look at dia ;) <a href=""http://www.netbeans.org/products/enterprise/index.html"">http://www.netbeans.org/products/enterprise/index.html</a> i can't download the stable enterprise pack I'm pretty sure that the enterprise pack is free. I think they may just be ashamed of the 5.0 enterprise pack. I've downloaded it before. i read somewhere that it costs 695$ I've never seen that. I can't really be 100% sure they don't charge for it, but I don't think they do. hmm",0

I'll read the scrollback, though, so you can keep leaving comments :) k thanks for the comments though! i think i'd just say if overflow != visible that border-box becomes padding-box k when background attachment is local nods box-shadow inset confuses me the examples in the draft show the shadow drawing over the background but how can that be shadows draw behind borders and backgrounds... is the stacking order flipped for inset shadows? if so, where does it say that ah nvm i see it ""and the inner shadows of an element are drawn immediately above the background of that element (below the borders and border image, if any).""",0

"Hmm. Any reason a ""vertical-align: middle;"" wouldn't work on an h2 element? from my experience vertical-align is pretty obnoxious Do you mean in appearance or behaviour? in getting it to work Ah, right.

(*^__^*) â¦â¦ you see it yes, we do have ""racial"" murders, most of us aren't pure-bred australians, it does not mean australians hate chinese, it just means there are bad people out there you are only 19?but i feel that you are in the quality of his dialogue no âhisâ in the quality of dialogue why thank you :) are u college? Not anymore, I did a web developer course a couple years ago, what about yourself? i am a college and my English is not so good it is not mother language You're English is alright, put it this way, I'm jealous you know a second language and I never had the patience to learn. So what are you studying? accounting it is a little hard because i don't like maths Hehe, that's a bit of a dilemma, but I guess that's what you have computers for these days :P dilemma = problem, my bad i have a dictionary haha have computer for? use computer to do what? well the computer can do all the maths so you don't have to :) you means this ,is it? oh,i know but i must face my exam can not bring computer oh that's a problem then :P so what made you want to be an accountant? so its a bit headache yeah, sounds like it china it is more popular o(???)o so i choose it i don't know what i want to be ?it is ? sorry a bit shame yeah well, a job's a job isn't it, there's not many fun jobs unfortunately u don't enjoy your job? i thought u must be like it No I don't, I've got a job but haven't worked in two months, it's silly, my boss treats people very badly if i were u ?i would leave soon I am, but I can't find a new job now? unemployment? yeah I should quit officially, but I'm lazy i feel u r a kind person ?God will Bless You Thank you, unfortunately I turned my back on God a couple years back. So what type of Christian are you? in my college life why are you turn back? i recognize god in my college life but i am not a committed Christian?i think you do not go to church and pray often? i go to family meeting once a week but this is in school china has no so many church Yes I made that assumption; at least there wouldn't be as many as Australia. yes ?so there are no church in my hometown i can not go it during my vocation Well I'm sure if you're putting in an effort in other ways, if there is a God he will still be happy with you. 3Q do you have msn? i want to be friends with u sure, <email/> ok",0
"Hello all! Hi c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca Hey a03bfa2a78d00389c65221c74759cbb4. Winding down for the evening. I have about three meetings tomorrow with my company about my involvement with the WG. Looks like they're very interested in supporting me. So a small victory in my world. :-) nice in what ways will they be supporting you? I'm guessing giving me more forecasted time to work with the WG, potential travel, suggestion/input sessions, etc. Right now I have ""any free time"" to work on it, but now I'm looking to get ~4 hours a week of dedicated involvement. nice Ah hey 8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc. How's your day been? And three meetings? they better provide lunch Oh they are. :-) c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca, pretty good actually. Department interviewed another graphic design intern today. I think that puts the total at 8 so far; no one stellar unfortunately I have no clue what my availability will now look like though, apparently our divisions head of technology said, ""Come to him for your accessibility and standards needs."" There goes all my slacker time. ;-) Wow, 8 interviews? We're interviewing web dev's right now for our team and we had a couple we wanted to take on but they were too ""new"" and we wouldn't have enough time to ramp them up until July. ""new"" meaning they had the skill, just not the experience. :-( I hate having to turn away talent. Luckily I wasn't involved in the interviews. I don't usually sit in on them since I'm the development lead for our team, not directly related to graphics. Ah yeah, it's always good to get a sense of personality though, would you be working with them in any fashion? Probably for branding purposes and on site at conferences. We're the Graphics & Conferences team Ahh yeah I remember you mentioning that. Are these college interns or recent grads? Mix of both, I think the one today was a recent grad. It's always an issue of, ""Do you take the eager student willing to do anything, or the recent grad needing that critical stepping stone into the professional world?"" The big killer so far is people being shy. Its a real interview killer if you don't talk and ask questions. So true! If the interview doesn't flow like a conversation, I instantly feel distant from the person to a certain degree. yeah Mornin' Hi 5b67d980ae4c3c82251106e26913ce67. Anything interesting happened here? Just 8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc and myself chatting about hiring. Yeah, I read it :) Yep, that quiet in here tonight. :-) How are you doing? Pretty good, downloading mails so I can read them in the bus Ah great! All the WG chatter? Only 55 today Yeah I need to spend a good while reading up on all these technologies that are flying around the mailing list. You'll get those 4 hours extra ;) I'm *very* new to the engineering of HTML so research and self-education is my key goal right now. Thanks! I hope so! Brb Sure thing. :-)",0

"tries to get his head around http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/2008/test-harness/ (and http://www.w3.org/2008/07/test-harness-css/ ) Oh cool, I was wondering where the source for that was. hmm... a little overboard on the comments. I could do without a 5-line ascii art block for ""Instance variables"" and screenfuls of echo/print statements... this is how php folks do it? sadly. there's no analog of perl HERE documents nor python triplequoted strings? there is it is not widely used... ah http://us3.php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php#language.types.string.syntax.heredoc and in PHP 5.3+: http://us3.php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php#language.types.string.syntax.nowdoc that's a recurring theme in PHP... lots of bits, not widely used. If you worked with strings in Python, you aren't going to be wowed by PHP. ok... blinders... never mind php style... regardless, I still have a soft spot for PHP because it is so stupidly easy to get something working in a very short time with almost no investment in the server-side deployment issues. something I can't say with Python... even though mod_wsgi has drastically improved matters. has it really? for quite a while I heard fastCGI stuff falls over randomly, and WSGI seems pretty similar to fastcgi last I looked at nearlyfreespeech.net , mod_wsgi was in demand but not yet deployed... and not looking very likely. supporting long-running processes is not something they do lightly gotta go to something like http://www.webfaction.com/ to use it",0

"3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653: it's relatively new 3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653: i don't think anyone's implemented it 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: I found paul_irish's blog post explaining it from like a year back ? (i wish they would implement it, i need it ;-) ) sounds about right maybe 9 months? seems to suggest that it's implemented in 3-4 browsers' beta versions, w/ reasonable polyfills to tide us over not aware of any beta implementations, but that would be nice url? 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: http://paulirish.com/2011/requestanimationframe-for-smart-animating/ oh i was talking about scrollPathIntoView oh, whoops sorry, nevermind right, blah heh I was looking at about 3 various specs yesterday, and forgot which I had mentioned in here (closed my IRC client, didn't bother to hit the logs) shouldn't be that hard to make a shim for scrollPathIntoView() 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: so um, I don't know much about scrollpathintoview... seems like there's very little info about it out there pretty easy if you limit yourself to rects, anyway scrollpathintoview is just what it sounds like scrolls the path into view yeah like element.scrollIntoView() 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: yeah, nice thing about a rect under an affine transform is that we can get a bounding box just from looking at the vertices same as for any polygon, for that matter bezier curves get a bit trickier it's not *that* hard math to calculate max/minima of affine transformed bezier curve, but it's not quite trivial 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: apologies for the mind-blank :D 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: what do you need scrollpathintoview for? i have a big canvas with animations going on in various parts and need to scroll the animating bit into view huh (think board games) are you making board games? :) just playing around to see what the api needs gotta go bbl cheers",0

"hi i've a question, i added a new syntax style and it seems to work properly however the indentetion is completely wrong.... what can i do? how is it wrong? doesn't indent at all? indents but incorrectly? .. it seems it doesn't indent at all turn autoindenting on :) even if the syntax is recognized i try...:D syntax highlighting isn't indenting it's just pretty colors from within vim how can i set it on done let me see if it works.. how do i stop vim from opening two files if I type at the command line 'vim new file' wanting a file named new file (with no connector) :set ai should do it Fryguy--: it doesn't work.. sigma957: put quotes around the file vim ""new file"" Fyrguy: thanks. knew it had to be something simple Vega___: :filetype indent on Vega___: what syntax are you doing? Fryguy--: where is the indent rule defined? varies i need to include the syntax for NesC i've found nc.vim for the syntax but i've done nothing for the indentetation.. the same as the C style could be good... but where i've to set it? use cindent then ok....to start could be enough :) btw where can i say to do it automatically ? your vimrc for instance for the syntax i modified a file adding this autocommand... in this case there is something similar? :h ftplugin-overrule goflyapig: that's for me? :D yep goflyapig: it seems i can simply modify the filetype in function of the file extension adding setft is it correct? :D you lost me. you can add filetype specific settings (like :set cindent) to ~/.vim/ftplugin/{filetype}.vim goflyapig: i modified /usr/share/vim/vim64/ftplug.vim and all work fine that's probably not a good idea. that will be replaced when you upgrade. so every user can benefit from it oh... i see. :D you've a point.. your distro might let you to have custom system-wide settings in some place like /etc/vim actually it does.. but in your home after to have created the right directories and put properly the files what do i have to do? :D i should have a local ftplugin.vim and filetype.vim i don't know how to write them...just copy the basic ones? with this lilttle modification? no ftplugin but indent.vim",0

"Anyone know why my CD Drive isn't even showing up in the Device Manager? it used to? Yeah It won't read CD's or DVD's did you move drives around or something? It doesn't appear in Device Manager, or My Computer. I don't think so. bjv, Any ideas? I think it's an HP DVD Writer 640i. anecdotal: i have had an HP cd burner slowly grow flaky then fail i fell back to an even older HP burner though. which has been rock solid, albeit x4 burn only fail? as in don't work at all forever? NOoo booting with the drive connected became unreliable, it would detect, but trying to read would get nothing. if i killed the power and restarted like 40 times, i could eventually get a CD to boot the machine, but it whirred and screamed like a devil. but yours does not show up at all. Well, it did. does it still eject, etc It had a yellow exclamation mark next to it, then I uninstalled the drivers, now it doesn't show up. Yeah ah, you uninstalled the drivers what OS? Windows which Windows? XP Home When I tried to install the ones from the HP website, it said Device not found, but that's because there was no previous drivers. I assumed. this sounds like a windows-specific question. i have heard that you can uninstall a device in windows and it will vanish, but i dont know anything about that. try asking in #windows. if they can find your device, chances of getting the drive back are good. (njdavid here) bjv: Hey Anyone alive? bjv: You there? woo: yes. they couldnt find the device? The device shows up now bjv But, it has a yellow exclamation mark next to it I opened up the comp and disconnected the reconnected. bjv: What now? :( when this yellow mark appeared, it stopped reading? Yes The mark means it's in a problem state if you did not change settings, install new software, and it just clicked on one day the hardware could have just failed ""Windows cannot load the device driver for this hardware. The driver may be corrupted or missing. (Code 39)"" ive used w2k abit, ive only ever seen the yellow mark next to 'unknown device' ah well, that sounds like your driver got corrupted or gone. :P Heh yeah i thought MS fixed that with ntfs. But when I try to download the ones on the hp site it says Devince not found Because there are no drivers there. I'm assuming. you tried the drivers again now that you have your entry back? Yeah maybe it's the wrong driver. what drivers were you using before? What do you mean? I don't know. I never messed with it 'till now. so the burner came with the computer. Yeah is there a Drivers or $OEM folder on your system drive? In system32, yeah. those are probably the currently installed drivers. sometimes Dell/whoever leaves a folder C: *c:\ drivers Yeah, they are the currently installed. I've never owned a Dell, I'm not stupid enough to do that. :-P lol, sometimes they are the cheapest out there though Hrm if there isnt a C:\Drivers\CDROM\ or similar, ive seen a 'upgrade drivers' option on a friends XP home machine can you get it to run the autodetect that way? Upgrade Drivers? Where? properties on the device, in the manager it may have been Reinstall Drivers, or something Well there is an Update Drivers, thing but it doesn't work? I wish I could find a way to extract the drivers from the exe. there is! Anyone know how to upgrade memory on a laptop? I've got an HP laptop with built-in RAM of 512MB and want to extend to 1GB total. Bought another chip that matches my system spec, but PC dies after 10 minutes with it onboard. -> Do I need the *EXACT* same vendor for this to work? i know about this only from putting together a 2000 server distro /w custom drivers. bjv: So how do I do it? well i dont know. there may not be for your particular .exe run it with /? and see what kind of options there are there could be an /E or something to extract the files to a directory Nope :( Although it seems as if it's a firmware upgrade, not a driver. ah well, it seems you need to find out how to get a driver installed in win XP for this drive there may be some underlying hardware issue, but it's hard to tell without drivers. I can't find the drivers anywhere. :( perhaps you can somehow figure out how to get a generic cdrom driver loaded in there Well there is. so you can read disks? Nope But there are drivers loaded. But they seem generic. you have a drive letter for the drive C:\WINDOWS\system32\DRIVERS\cdrom.sys C:\WINDOWS\system32\DRIVERS\imapi.sys C:\WINDOWS\system32\Drivers\PxHelp20.sys C:\WINDOWS\system32\DRIVERS\redbook.sys C:\WINDOWS\system32\storprop.dll bjv: Nope. bjv: Only appears in Device Manager, and it shows with a yellow exclamation mark next to is. was the yellow error different before you uninstalled the driver? Nope it has always been a code XYZ, drivers missing or corrupt, then. The firmware upgrade has a fix labelled: ""Fixed CD-ROM disc mount issue"" even an empty drive should have a letter made for it, though. Dunno. :( i dont know. This blows. I was going to burn a Dapper Drake cd too, that's how I noticed it wasn't working. Damnit. all i can say is take your (Code 39) to #windows and google and try and get some generic drivers loaded properly, or the real ones if you can. lol. im waiting for my dapper CD's still to come in the mail. Even those won't work for me.. :( ;P i may manage to finish the upgrade over my 56k before they show up. haha Damn Why no Broadband? ha, i dont pay on the line. as i have a mobile phone. and as a result, i only see $8/mo for my ISP and that's it ah I'm starting to get fucking pissed off.",0

"oh I am so pissed!!!! I'm more pissed than I was at the pathetic telco apparently pacwireless can't keep enclosures onhand anymore. 4 week backorder. FOUR WEEKS ""do this"" :o tigit which enclosure? J4k3, cpm: the 6x7x2 the diecast aluminum one can't find it. Is it on the pacwireless page? or on wlanparts? its the same thing they sell as the mesh box <a href=""http://everest.wisp-router.com/index.asp"">http://everest.wisp-router.com/index.asp</a> its wisp-router's top selling item :) that they currently have -298 of in stock. err -288 err -289 whatever lol so, it's likea 6x7x2 nema box? why not just get a pvc one from homedepot? :) home depot wants more, doesn't include mast mounting hardware, etc. and well... I've taken a lot of lightning and so far all I've lost has been two capacitors on the routerboards. one was a 532, broke the 48v side. Swapped it with a 24V PSU and moved the jumper over in the box... problem solved. Without sounding like at stupid scriptkiddie :) I can't find my key to my wireless network :/ However - i have serveral computers which already ""have it"" - is it possible to find it? other was an RB112. cracked the ""ohshit"" capacitor... replaced it, problem solved. ""have it"" are on the wireless now. I mean - they must have the ket somewhere :P *""have it"" = are.... well, going to the foundry will solve the 'box' part of the issue, but the mounting hwd etc, will be something you'll have to deal with on your own anyway. Electrical supply house should be able to do you good too, if you have to source the mast mount stuff anyway ok here i go again: I am wondering how do I set WEP key on wireless card with ""iwconfig"" I always get the error : ""Error for wireless request ""set Encode"" 8B2A, set failed on device wlan0 ; Invalid argument"" have you called'em? web site could be giving out bogosity cpm: not yet. an IRL friend's grandfather owns the business, and afaik they're in colorado or on their way back right now (lucky bastards take vacations..) heh oh, titanwirelessonline says they're on 4 week backorder which has be FREAKING OUT since they owe me two of their 900 mhz CPEs ($40 less than buying hte pieces by themselves) if they're talking about backordering those for 4 weeks, I'ma kick their asses (or tell them to ship w/o enclosure) seems like demand is pretty high eh? wonder what's up. I thought everyone was rolling out WiMax :) I've seen those *exact* boxes used in some crazy crazy ways. hahaha wiwhat? heh like my friend's works for a pool shop they use THOSE EXACT BOXES purchased from wisp-router because they ""couldn't find anything as nice"" otherwise. thats what I get for showing people my sexy boxes. err my friend... delete the 's for 900 CPE I really don't *need* mast mounting since I could run LMR400 for a half a mile and not make a lot of difference.",0

"Ok, so if I have <p><b></p> <p> does the space get wrapped by <b>? I'm leaning towards yes, althought the test case claims it doesn't. Also, the Python implementation agrees with me So does the Ruby implementation (could it be? could eca88ce0deea1275223afe139b2595e2 have actually found a real test-case bug? It could be a spec bug, since what then happens is we stick the <p> inside the <b><i><u> tags, which is not what active formatting elements is supposed to do. Any comments? eca88ce0deea1275223afe139b2595e2: WDVND? come again? (What does Validator.nu do?) Oh, yeah V.nu does the test-case behavior I guess I could figure out what they did different. eca88ce0deea1275223afe139b2595e2: Henri is generally more up to date than html5lib. Although there is a case with whitespace that he preemptively changed anticipating a spec change that hasn't happened Yep, that seems like it. b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 is not reconstructing active formatting elements when there's whitespace The spec hasn't changed w.r.t. yet, though I thought tokenizing/treebuilding was pretty stable now? ""Update the tree building tests with frameset-ok, new AAA and (not yet in spec) WebKit-style foster-parenting"" if something depends on whitespace in 'in body', it's likely a bug So it's the webkit thing again :-) oh, you meant foster parenting that's deliberate So, I understand that the spec may not be at the point that V.nu is But having tests that the spec deliberately fails really doesn't help me out, if I'm trying for 0 fails eca88ce0deea1275223afe139b2595e2: when I checked that in, Hixie's IRC statements hinted at spec going that way Anyway, it's whitespace ""in body"" Specifically, the difference is V.nu checks if a character token is whitespace, and if it is, doesn't reconstruct active formatting elements eca88ce0deea1275223afe139b2595e2: not while foster parenting? Nope. No foster parenting at all. You changed the test case, however, in commit 535a1040e2df weird for which I just posted the summary wait, have the test cases moved to hg? I've been checking in to svn still Yes. ouch Does Google Code magically transfer it? I mean, there's no way to tell if there was an svn repository from Google Code website anymore eca88ce0deea1275223afe139b2595e2: Dunno.

I'm not on the computer that has my html5lib sandbox Anyway, not turning off access to the subversion repos seems... poor. I'm not sure how we can easily merge your changes back in. eca88ce0deea1275223afe139b2595e2: https://html5lib.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ Awesome It seems like svn should become read-only (I mean ideally, not that it does) AWesome, we only lost one commit (maybe two, if one of those was in a branch) b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: you can probably take its diff and apply to the new hg repository I haven't committed to branches eca88ce0deea1275223afe139b2595e2: I'll do that when I get to my work computer Odd. 1303 has nothing in it Great. Holy crap that's a big change Oh, these are all tokenizer updates Hmm... we already pass all of the tests... uh oh Anyway, b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9, you maintain that Hixie is going to change the spec to follow V.nu behavior? eca88ce0deea1275223afe139b2595e2: I intend to keep pushing Hixie that way :-) ...huh. The <header> tag has changed functionality? catches up on the blog reading ...am I really only allowed to use <header> with <h#>? eca88ce0deea1275223afe139b2595e2: the tokenizer changed to discard tag token if EOF happens inside tag Ok. Do you mind if I separate out that test to its own file?

I should document this somewhere ok b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: I assume test 44 is another one of those?

"I had dinner with friends who make software two of them have done XML signatures and said that one should avoid XML signatures if one wants interop b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: why is that? because not enough implementations handle XML signatures, or because they don't handle them interoperably? a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: because XML signatures depend on canonicalized serialization of XML and everyone has bugs in the canonicalizing serializer ah yeah, that seems like a weak design I wonder how many of the bugs are due to ambiguities in the Canonicalization spec? as I understand it, it's mainly that UTF-8 is tough, Namespaces are tough and string interning is tough all in all, serializing XML is tough so in the case of the Widgets work, it really doesn't seem like it's necessary to use XML signatures if something less complex and more robust will work instead seems that way to me b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: btw, I notice that the xhtml5core.rnc whattf driver doesn't toggle off the <mark> element the way that the html5core.rnc driver does do you recall of that's by design for some reason? a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: seems like a bug OK I'll try to fix it in the patch I'm working on for generating the driver files b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: I notice also that xhtml5core.rnc has ""v5only = notAllowed"" but html5core.rnc does not b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: ah, I see that v5only is, among other things, used to toggle the <mark> element so seems like the 'include ""phrase.rnc"" { mark.elem = empty }' part is maybe not necessary if html5core.rnc uses ""v5only = notAllowed"" instead too a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: yeah, the bug is probably the other way round than first thought b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: OK",0

"being hammered on port 16160 anyone know what might be coming in on that port hi all i need help... please wait... no :) ok i'm ready...i get this ""debug"" error on each tty....so i cannot login, neither prompt for commands: <a href=""http://monoport.com/1376"">http://monoport.com/1376</a> fortunately this message starts every 25 sec. so i can write something between a message and the next there are 2 things that i cannot understand: 1) i did not create my own iptables rules, rp-pppoe does it for me...and i did not upgrade that program. So why i get only now this debug message? 2) why i get that message on each tty if my syslog-ng is configured to print only on tty-12? someone could help me, please? i tried to search with google....but i was no lucky... suggestions? ideas? Hello people. This might sound like an obvious matter, still STFW yields nothing. I have a setup with three NICs, one goes to Internet and is NAT'ed, and two other go to mutually isolated LANs, with identical setups. The problem is that eth1 is okay, but eth2, while set up with the same rules, cannot get anywhere. ping returns 'sendmsg: Operation not permitted', no matter whether from root or from regular user. raven79 are you sure this is an error? and not your firewall just logging things xenoterracide: no, i'm not... the error is the fact that syslog-ng must write debug messages only on tty12 and not on each tty as firts and the second problem is why i get only now those debug messages? raven79: maybe log priority is too high someone could help me to modify it? raven79: AFAIR everything higher than 'info' will go on all ttys whats the output of iptables -L -v raven79 jafd: i did not create my own iptables rules...rp-pppoe does it for me... that looks like info ok I think it's just a log message those ports don't show up in etc services and that usaully means nothing good is on them secondly it's inbound traffic infact xenoterracide i think you are right...but i'm not able to stop it... iptables -L -v yes...please wait...i'm working for you ;) <a href=""http://monoport.com/1377"">http://monoport.com/1377</a> could it be 80 lines? Is there any tool to track which rules a packet is going through? ""there"" where? sorry jafd my english is bad...are you asking <b>me</b> if i has any tool.... or is it a question at the channel? jafd umm... yes and no you can see what rules are being used if you look at the ouput of iptables -L -v and you can log packets and analyse them to see which rule they are going through raven79 do you want the logging to go away? ok iptables -A LOG_FILTER -j DROP should end all logging because no packets will ever get to the log rule is normal that i get all that debug messages into kernel too? (dmesg) yeah because IPTABLES messages are from the kernel ah ok...i starting to think done a bad kernel compilation xenoterracide: where i must add that rule? into which table/chain? just the way I put it ah ok there is nothing currently in LOG_FILTER so it will be the first rule but that will add permantently that rule? and that chain seems to be before all log functions or i must give that command at each reboot ? does iptables start on reboot? what distro do you use the first rule? or the last rule? -A should be ""Append""... gentoo xenoterracide: yes every restart iptables starts k then you should just be able to do an /etc/init.d/iptables restart to see if it will stay ok thanks ;) i'm tring... /etc/init.d/iptables save will save your rules but /etc/init.d/iptables stop saves them too infact the rule is saved... that's ok now i will leave (for fewev minute) to see if in console i get some debug message too...thanks for now right np oh xenoterracide another question...i create my own rules, i will load them successfully, then i try to see what rules are loaded(iptables-save). But why when i start adsl link my iptables rules changes? iptables rules should not be fixed? i mean that after starting adsl, my rules are interleaved with other iptables lines (not mine)... is it normal? ask a gentoo dev.... sounds like maybe rp-ppoe is creating and modifying rules ah ok thanks! you should check the script that your running to see exactly what it's doing if it's doing something you don't think it should do complain on bugzilla if you think it's a bug if I specify a rule --dport x --sport x does that rule require both to be true? or one or the other",0

"I've just said: ""one huge ommission from html imho, is that you can't include remote document fragments, would cater for many needs which are thrown on to ""ajax"" and iframes"" - and somebodies replied that you can do this in HTML5 is that right? pointer to a spec or section? <iframe>?

Early details here... http://hashbbg.com/bbgmeetup/2012/02/29/3rd-bbgmeetup.html hey paul_irish , for the html5 boilerplate build script, how does it order javascript files when concatenating? 7d616f275cbcbe1e444eabf4157f3227: file name? there is no set order but for example, i need scripts.js (my custom document ready code) to fire after the plugins, otherwise it will break actually it might be alphabetical anyone know for sure? yeah thats what i mean 7d616f275cbcbe1e444eabf4157f3227 it is alphabetical. you should put your plugins in libs folder does the folder path name count? they are in the libs folder huh they are still concatinating?! we recently changed the folder view removing mylibs and having only libs are u using the latest one? k i remember i changed it to only concat if its not minimized should probably exclude the whole libs folder https://github.com/h5bp/ant-build-script/blob/master/build.xml#L572 Is a user/pass in a URL valid? https://user:<email/>/ It works in all browsers except IE8/IE9 2cdd7064b290132617248dbfd85f740e: how can i check the version of my build script? 7d616f275cbcbe1e444eabf4157f3227: we dont version it, but it was separated from h5bp so the project is here now and the tools should be all newer versions like here https://github.com/h5bp/ant-build-script/blob/master/config/default.properties#L103 i'm pretty sure i haven't the latest one .. also i did notice builds are taking like 45 seconds now, and was around 9 seconds when i had the older version i have* the latest one i am supposed to include the libs js files in my index.html right? or is there something i write that includes the whole folder 7d616f275cbcbe1e444eabf4157f3227: i would recommend you try the new one. Also if you have images being optimized then it would take time so if you want smthing quick then maybe just ant build text would be sufficient",0

"how do I extend the not yet standardized Link header with an additional link-param that Mark refuses to add? if nobody comes up with something I'll ask him which param? media planet: CSSOM: New Beginning <http://annevankesteren.nl/2009/10/cssom-new-beginning> http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom/#requirements-on-user-agents-implementing0 says how it ought to work Title: CSSOM (at dev.w3.org) but I suppose I should register it or something to make it ""official"" the spec on title* won't work, unless there's some other place in the spec that deals with the encoding doesn't his spec do that? or whatever his spec references yes, but you simply say ""Let title be the value of the first of all the title and title* parameters. If there are no such parameters it is the empty string. "" would ""decoded value"" work? it appears that the media parameter is specific to the stylesheet link relation not really yes, ""decoded per ...."" can you please fill in the dots? as per RFC 2231 or, if you can wait a bit http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/draft-reschke-rfc2231-in-http-latest.html maybe I should ask for a concept that defines the collection of titles Title: Application of RFC 2231 Encoding to Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Headers (at greenbytes.de) of which I can then pick the first because if each link relation spec needs to define this that'd be madness anyway, media applies to all relation types so what's the semantics of media, if not specific to stylesheets? e.g. <link rel=alternate media=print href=...> i agree that it applies to alternate as well, but I'm not convinced it's generic. the fact that HTML's link element has it though supports you view any kind of relation could have a document in another media afaict just like it can be in a different type rel=author href=""mailto:<email/>"" where's the media aspect here? but of course it's not necessary that any param applies to all link types where's the type aspect there? none of this really answers my question though I would recommend to send a proposal, or to send a reminder with a link to the initial proposal it was already rejected anyway, thanks one issue is what shoud Mark's spec reference for this? HTML 4.01 link/@media? Media Queries? anyway, he doesn't want it, so I'm wondering how to register an extension that's an editor's draft. For a proposed standard you'd need something else 60659cfda992013e610f285c46692d28: It's a CR 60659cfda992013e610f285c46692d28: http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/ Title: Media Queries (at www.w3.org) oh, i followed the link from the HML5 spec which leads somewhere else it leads to dev.w3.org/csswg which is the editor's draft bugmail: [Bug 6606] generic 3rd-party <mark>, Smart Tags, and Accelerators prevention <http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html-bugzilla/2009Oct/0195.html> ** [Bug 7920] New: media queries ref <http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html-bugzilla/2009Oct/0194.html> ** [Bug 7918] New: prefetching: allow site to deny <http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html-bugzilla/2009Oct/0193.html> it's pretty close to REC just need to sort out the test suite need to find some volunteer for that or do it myself I suppose",0

"ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: I'm amazed at how long a sort -R of dmoz urls is taking b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f: How much RAM do you have? just the 2GB I think 'sort' uses temporary files as scratch space when it's processing a lot of data The first time I did this, I used Perl to slurp the entire file into an array in memory and then randomise it and print it out again which used rather a lot of RAM, but did actually work and didn't take forever (but wasn't particularly fast either) appears to only be using ~40% of RAM at the moment where ""rather a lot"" was a bit more than 2GB, if I remember correctly (on a machine with 4GB RAM, so that was alright) ouch I don't have any machines with RAM >2GB times like these it would be nice to have a shell account on a supercomputer You could trim the file down substantially, e.g. skip a random 99% of the lines, and then randomise the output from that (By the way, be careful to remove duplicate URLs, and be careful to unescape the RDF XML (which I forgot to do since I just parsed it with regexps :-( )) yeah, I did the replacements and uniq stuff I found a very efficient method of extracting the URLs was simply perl -i -pe 's/&quot;/""/g' uniq-urllist grep ""&"" uniq-urllist | grep -v ""amp"" perl -i -pe 's/&amp;/&/g' uniq-urllist er, that was the wrong thing to paste 'grep ""http://"" content.rdf.u8 | cut -d\"" -f2 >urllist' is what I meant then ""grep ^http"" again, to filter out the odd description/name which had an URL in it Just out of interest, do you find 'grep' to be massively slower than 'LANG=C grep'? That was a pain to me when dealing with large files, until I realised setting LANG made it much faster, probably because my default locale was doing UTF-8 decoding of every line or something LANG=c is faster, but only by about 1% or so my normal LANG is en_GB.UTF-8 Hmm, I'm using en_GB.UTF-8 by default too, but it goes ~30x faster with LANG=c on at least the two computers (one Gentoo, one Fedora) I've tested it on I'm an Ubuntuite",0

I went to a different school freshman year and it was our goal to get on every building on campus at least once and yes see i'm not going to see my college experience as complete until i get on that damn roof try again next week i guess yeah it's triumph we managed instead to get inside one of the buildings where prof offices are, not very exciting but i had to make a point what point was that? that i was going to go somewhere where i wasn't supposed to be but really... it's very low risk here if security had caught us they would have told us to go home and just watched to make sure we walked away haha gotta get more outrageous than that! true",0

"o/ is there anyone here from disqus? if i set event handler, then the handler function's 'this' will refer to event caller? 7a205621b91e4878465075e964d2b1e8: two of them hang here usually i see one of them now 4c681049601b3c374f1d2c0077c99049: I talked to anton as he had to leave, so I just sent him an email :-), thank you anyways! k 30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2: are you using any libraries to normalize the event object accross browsers?! no if so, whithin the handler this will be the same as event.target (this might be specific to jQuery) i have rather specific problem, but not related to jQuery, just plain javascript 30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2: have you tryed to console.log the this to see its value? sec, i already asked in #javascript some time ago MyClass.prototype.f = function() {}; MyClass.prototype.g = function() { Something.onload = function() { ""call f"" }; }; <- how to refer to function f inside function h? i cannot use 'this' in the callback since it refers to something's context You can us .bind, but you'll need a shim for older browsers in java you have similar problem with anonymous inner classes, but you can refer to outer instance using OuterClassName.this right, you can do the same InstanceOfMyClass.f() --> this = InstanceOfMyClass i tried to use MyClass.prototype.f() but it seems to refer to something else than original instance Something.onload = function () { InstanceOfMyClass.f() } Are you creating a instance class or static? hm, i instance class? then instead of calling it using MyClass.prototype.f() you should use the instatiated object's f function, not the prototypes hm, i have no idea about that, sec, i try to paste some code use jsfiddle to show what you're doing http://pastebin.com/D7VqhZHK hm, it's plain old javascript, no libraries or anything lines 25 and 30 are problematic within the search method you can create a variable referencing this, eg: var that = this; then within the onload function you can call the addEntry within the right context with that.addEntry(...); hm, thought there was another way anyway, thanks, seems like it's the only solution That is how I normaly do it, if there is a better way, I would like to know :-) also, i got eclipse javascript support working, came out i had to enable it manually for the project anyway, it asks me to place lot of semicolons check your javascript code with JSHint hm it outputs lot of errors Better start fixing :-) ok, two errors are left ""Use the function form of ""use strict""."" <- doesn't function form prevent me accessing my classes outside the script? http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2010/12/14/strict-mode-is-coming-to-town/ so basically i need to wrap my script around large anonymous function? pretty much yeah inside* it's a good practice, if you look at the source code for most popular 3rd party js code, you'll see that they all do it (function (window, undefined) { ...you script here... }) (window); hm, my script parts on the .html cannot anymore accept classes from the script file if i do not use any 3rd party libs and do not write a lib, i think it should be safe to leave out the function wrapper use a global common namespace hm, how would i assign my class to it? Just like you would normally you should probably google around a little bit about how to use namespaces and good practices around javascript it will answer these questions http://na.isobar.com/standards/ this is a good place to start nice, i wrote my code using module concepts also eclipse recognizes it anyway, some parts of code are rather verbose: media.ResultsArea.prototype.clear = function() { media is the module name, is it possible to make such definitions shorter? I don't think so 5b9cb20d2f71fee5f77d39d8e5b3129c: https://github.com/jankuca/dom-panda appears to be same as the html2canvas approach yeah, which is pretty odd this seems exactly like html2canvas html2canvas takes the DOM and then, given the precomputed properties available from the DOM, draws an image to a canvas kinda reinventing the wheel 4c681049601b3c374f1d2c0077c99049: though it does look nicer and oddly it creates it's own NodeWalker O_o TreeWalker* which is already available in the DOM ok, now the second error to go http://pastebin.com/YiBmazdm <- having two loops with same loop variable quick fix would be to rename the second loop variable name but are there another ways? hm, just need to drop var from second loop",0

"b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9, anyone: could you read http://hoppipolla.co.uk/410/120.txt and see if it makes sense, please? b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: looking ""... itâÃÃ´s important for site developers to test their site in the Compatibility View Browser Mode."" http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2010/10/19/testing-sites-with-browser-mode-vs-doc-mode.aspx b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: looks good cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0: aargh! :-( cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0: on the bright side, it appears that IE9 itself doesn't (outside dev tools) provide UI for running the browser in the IE8 browser mode or the IE7 browser mode cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0: though I gather that apps that embed Trident can do that I wonder why no one ever mentions the possibility of moving RDFa out of HTML WG in the objections. The proposed change in Hixie's proposal is too large that it can't be acceptable. since ie9 uses the same mode as the parent frame, i guess it's also ""important"" to test the site in the IE 5.5 mode if you care about being framed on arbitrary sites b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: the context of the sentence was the compatibility mode button s/mode/view/ i thought the x-ua-compatible would override compatibility view? cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0: yeah, but I think it's very sad to put effort into making the site work if the user presses a ""break design"" button cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0: X-UA-Compatible overrides the button and hides the button cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0: also overrides the pref for displaying all sites in compat mode i wonder why microsoft now recommends wasting even more time over using x-ua-compatible there's no way an average user is going to last even a day without Flash Player using IE9 :-( the browser is so eager to prompt for drive-by installs of Flash Player ""As long as developers need document modes to run their sites, weâÃÃ´re going to support them. We want to remove document modes as soon as the web transitions to run in the latest standards mode. The timing is really up to developers."" cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0: whoa! looks like I need to retest the framing bit. :-( Translation: We're never going to remove any document modes. b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: i haven't tested it myself, but somebody on sitepoint forums said ie9 would use quirks mode if the parent frame uses quirks mode regardless of doctype or x-ua-compatible, iirc note to self: always retest *everything* well, *this* is weird when framed by a quirky page, it seems that X-UA-Compatible: IE=9 only elevates to mode to 8 I need to draw some new decision diamonds for my chart if my framing testing so far is right, this is gonna be bad news for HTML5 video embedding iframes since <video> requires IE9 mode",0

"85793dd1775fbc0c0562493f069bcaa2: saw your mention of WebKit-based Epiphany. You know there's a quite good WebKit-based browser UI that runs on Linux now (or any Qt environment) - Arora: http://code.google.com/p/arora/ very easy to build I think it's even packaged for Debian now epiphany-webkit also runs decently as does Midori (another Gtk/WebKit browser) last time I tried epiphany-webkit I found it unusable but I've not tried since a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: IIRC, it drags half of KDE with it *shrug* I'm not a Linux guy, so I guess I should not really opine on these things hm, no, it didn't I'll try it 85793dd1775fbc0c0562493f069bcaa2: if you get to using it and find any bugs or have questions, there's an #arora channel on freenode.. the main developer is usually there (icefox/ Benjamin Meyer) as well as others it seems to lag behind the other two webkit browsers transformations and animations didn't work, for instance 85793dd1775fbc0c0562493f069bcaa2: that may be because that stuffs not working yet in QtWebKit .. or you may need to check out latest WebKit source and build against that http://svn.webkit.org/repository/webkit/trunk or against WebKit nightlies for Linux Qt 4.4 is based on an older WebKit you can build against a different QtWebkit version by doing ""export QT_WEBKIT=webkit_trunk"" and setting WEBKITDIR, pointing to wherever you got your latest WebKit workspace/nightly checked-out/built/installed http://code.google.com/p/arora/wiki/source you can also build against Qt 4.5 snapshots if you care to marcos: why delete the preference store? let's say you have a widget implementation that doesn't implement html5 -- you're stuck without a storage API then 85793dd1775fbc0c0562493f069bcaa2: the implementation would not need to implement all of HTML5 -- just the relevant storage stuff a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: my point is that there are unwebby widget implementations as-is Yahoo widgets, for instance would the preferences-store spec be easier for those implementations to add support for than the HTML5 storage stuff would be? are those unwebby things DOM-based? the HTML5 storage spec seems not so complicated to implement (relative to others parts of the HTML5 spec at least) for someone that doesn't neccesarily implement window as the global object, yes having said that, I am not 100% sure we SHOULD cater to such implementations 85793dd1775fbc0c0562493f069bcaa2: yeah, I'd guess you'll find little disagreement in the webapps WG about that having said that, there might also be other requirements such as encrypted storage",0

But in absolute numbers - indian population is one of bigest on the world :-) but there are some good oracle specialists from India - Rama Velpuri, for example. and... hali, this sums are with taxes, or it is cash on hands? consultant fees.. including taxes and all that thnx :-) i thought hali is babbling with himself ^^ for first time i will be indian :-) gmflie, :-) hali and hell is quite indifferent from each other on a quick glance",0

"Talked on the phone for almost an hour -- first after 14 months. :) Ionox, with who ? a girl :) Yes, a girl... my record is 5h and 40 min :) lol Oh, I forgot to mention, the girl happened to be my sister. ;pppp lyken, evil is always there when you dont want him to be :) lol dont make me cut you 5hrs in your situation not too long. I've never been a fond of phone conversations. Usually imagining people tossing themselves around on their beds talking non-sense. Ok, after 2 hours on the phone, I would consider either meeting with the individual. Ionox, what else can a man talk about when he is talking to a woman :) ""Hey, This morning I had a problem deploying my application. I should check my resources..."" How's that for starters? fine :) the conversation will takes 5 min if you start like that Well, that depends how good you are. You start the conversation like that and keep it for 5 hours then I give you some points. :) :) that was a couple of years ago i lost my skills and got some more kg lost some hair ... mhh it would be hard now :P Hahah. Na, 6' 3"", 190lbs... NEVER. you units looks like your from mars your units looks like your from mars I'm from Sun. thats why your burning hot :P I got disengaged from the start and came to this planet to cool off so I lost the instinct I once possessed. hahah :) s/start/star s/haha/heheh :D Haha. That was the first. I prefer IRC over IM anytime. me too <a href=""http://englishrussia.com/?p=313"">http://englishrussia.com/?p=313</a> [me] bless all photo-journalists. It's disheartening in a way... Like that mother from Texas who almost drawned his son under water... Now he is some serious mental issues. What was her name... Oh ya, Barbara Bush! lol Why on earth does Germany even allow the U.S. to use their bases? I thought WWII was long over! over ? Ya, we are in WWIII. yep the war or humanity has began by lobys and arrivists Lobsters and arriqits. :) yup its sad how individums knows about it and can do nothing against it We need another Mahatma Gondhi. :) Lobsters and arrigits owns the money and so the polotician who own ""the law"" Someone with waist size of one or below. Ya, has anyone noticed CIA actually is a business organization working for its clients, lobbyists and other affiliated political machine! Ionox, lyken okay guys good night its time here :) Wow, going to bed before 4AM... G'night. :)) merci mon ami Hah, ok, talk to you tomorrow. yup :)",0

". o ('>) LL sacrifices the chicken to summon annevk or abarth poor chicken :-( abarth asked for XMLDocument to be specced (with .async and .load()) i'm hoping i can convince anne to spec it in XHR hmm but in their absence, i'm having to spec it myself curse the time zone difference! I think the primary use is via createDocument() not XHR oh it has nothing to do with XHR except that it'd reuse a lot of his infrastructure it has nothing to do with HTML either I also once again idly wonder if it is ""compatible enough"" to omit the sync version but there we go yeah i saw your mail about that i have no data either way currently webkit browsers don't do it at all because synchronous I/O is the devil so in some sense, we can omit it altogether... abarth provided fairly compelling evidence that it is a nontrivial compatibility loss yes we also found compelling evidence that you can't just add the load() method to all documents yes by hunting around in old mozilla bugs no data specific to the sync version afaik Is it intended behavior for it to be impossible to style the weight of the text in <option>? i don't understand how document.load() interacts with DOM manipulation of the document in question it seems to be racy in particular, document.load() empties the DOM of the document object, but then if you append a node immediately, what should happen? anyone got IE? what does IE do with something like http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?%3C!DOCTYPE%20html%3E%0D%0A%3Cscript%3E%0D%0A%20%20%20var%20xmlDoc%20%3D%20document.implementation.createDocument(%22%22%2C%20%22%22%2C%20null)%3B%0D%0A%20%20%20w('A%3A%20'%20%2B%20xmlDoc.documentElement)%3B%0D%0A%20%20%20xmlDoc.appendChild(xmlDoc.createElement('test'))%3B%0D%0A%20%20%20w('B%3A%20'%20%2B%20xmlDoc.documentElement)%3B%0D%0A%20%20%20xmlDoc.onload%2 make that http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/575 blimey, xhr is non-trivial these days",0

"anyone 'do' mingw with devcpp ? hei hei my brain hurts! can anyone help me with a c++ related problem? I think I have an understanding problem here.. go ahead in my main function I read in data and save them into a struct.. the struct is defined global, but I set the size of it's variables in main..then I call my qwt plot method to plot the data from the array.. so I probably have to give a pointer to the array to the method.. is there no other way to store data globally so all methods can access it? can you paste the source at qtnode.net so that i can see yes, I will reduce it a bit so you can see.. 'delta_' pasted ""main.cpp"": <a href=""http://qtnode.net/pastebin/1028"">http://qtnode.net/pastebin/1028</a> that's it.. where is the struct global? oh, sorry.. no it's not.. because I don't know how to change it's size in main, when it's global.. what do you mean, change its size? because in main I find out how big the data array has to be, according to the size of the infile.. well, you've got generally the right idea, if your data is variable size, that you are pointing to an array but there's nothing wrong with... in main I assign memory to blockdata.data with ""new double[size]"" where the size information I get from the file I read.. 'Anonymous' pasted ""main.cpp"": <a href=""http://qtnode.net/pastebin/1029"">http://qtnode.net/pastebin/1029</a> but do I have to give a pointer to the array from main to MainWin, and then from MainWin again to blockplot? yes, unless it's global like i pasted ah, I see.. so I can change the size of the global struct? 'Anonymous' pasted ""main.cpp"": <a href=""http://qtnode.net/pastebin/1030"">http://qtnode.net/pastebin/1030</a> you can also declare the blockdata like that in the same struct but... you're not changing the size of the struct in either case so that's where i'm not following you hmm, I think I am confused about how structs are saved in memory.. they are saved serially, exactly as you define them but what you've defined is a double * that's simple a pointer to a double s/simple.simply for the sake of discussion, let's say int stores two bytes oh, so I have a struct in mem, on the position it gets put while it gets globally defined.. and the pointer to the double in it just points to an array of doubles of the size ""size"" I assign to it later? float stores 4 yes, double * points to some other array of memory then I get it :) which is variable size this isn't even c++ ;) now I feel ashame.. you should probably store .size. in your struct as well so that whoever gets the struct, knows how many doubles are being pointed to that's a good idea.. and there are probably better ways of setting this up what you've got here is pretty error prone I thought about having a method that stores the data for me.. with functions to get data in and out.. there's nothing 'wrong' with it, but you've got to be careful Hi all well, the thing to do is declare a class BlockData instead of a struct i want to learn to make a program with qt and i was wondering if you can point me to a qt4 for dummies sort of thing thats free online for me to use to learn to program that would be c++ Ace2007, check out qtnode.net there's a link on that home page 'My First Qt Program"" or did you try: <a href=""http://doc.trolltech.com/4.1/examples.html"">http://doc.trolltech.com/4.1/examples.html</a> there you find a lot of tutorial.. yay thanks Delt_, what you would do is define BlockData as a class, and then give it a method like open() and then that method can take care of allocating the double space for that object, storing it, assigning the pointers, and also making sure it can remember how many doubles were allocated and so on... then the BlockData destructor would clean all that up and that would be more object oriented and safer but... these are oo suggestions that's right, but what I don't understand about that is, how can I access the same class from different classes, like from main, and from plotdata? well, you're already doing that in a sense BlockData is currently a struct, and structs are just the precursor to objects how familiar are you with object-oriented programming methods? I know the basics.. I know it's one step further than a struct.. because I can have functions in it.. not just data.. right so, interpret() already accepts a struct it looks like hi there if you simple replace 'struct BlockData' with 'class BlockData' you'd have an object. then, to do it the oo way, you'd place the code to load the struct (class) with the data from the file <<inside>> the class, instead of inside main() I want to reimplement mouseReleaseEvent in a class derived from qlistview and that object is global, because it's defined global.. But somehow the mousereleaseevent never gets called. correct although, you'd have to say... that sounds easy .. Do have to set something first? 'marlo' pasted ""main.cpp"": <a href=""http://qtnode.net/pastebin/1031"">http://qtnode.net/pastebin/1031</a> now, that's a class i don't see code for interpret() but if i'm understanding what it does, it probably belongs inside that class yes, it does.. it reads data from memblock , interprets it, and saves it into blockdata think of it this way, there's a file on disk, and it's an object... a file object, right? all you do with block data is create a c++ object that 'models' that file object more intelligently rather than just binary so, blockdata is 'smart' it 'knows' what all that data is and you can tell it things like load() and save() that's the advantage of oo.. I know.. I probably could save the data I read from the file directly into the blockdata class too.. well, possibly, except that you're dynamically allocating some of the space for that data I'll try this now.. but, also, you might eliminate the .abweichung. .mittelwert. .referenzwert. and so on and make those functions also if they were functions, then you could simple load the binary file into the class buffer, that gets dynamically allocated, and then 'interpret' those values on the fly when requested s/simple/simply THAT would be oo instead of data in a struct, you'd have functions (that looked like data) in a class and once you did that you'd be able to control access and make a much safer object structs have no control what so ever, and therefore no safety with a class, you can build in safety and intelligence and that's oo this is my first oo program :) so I am still learning.. well, there's nothing wrong with it, like i said. it's just dangerous allocating global data and then managing that data in various functions spread around your program is unsafe, and oo can provide an environment where its safer if that makes sense it does.. and it's the better way to do it.. well, procedural programs are fine, but as programs get larger, oo helps (can help) to make things more organized... but there's a lot of lattitude left to the programmer, so oo environments, especially c++ often get a bad wrap unfairly. I spend most of my time doing embedded dsp programming.. there it's all just c.. yea, but depending on the size of your project you've probably been thinking oo and not realizing it i was when i was doing embedded work because of the limited memory you almost do everything global.. yea, that's true it's a mess when the projects get bigger.. that's probably where c++ gets a bad wrap, because there's more abstraction and therefore more pointers popping around on stacks and whatnot and that's tough on an embedded project but i've implemented some c++ on a memory-tight imbedded project and with some planning it works out quite nice, because the program gets reorganized logically source-code wize without impacting the memory required to support it. anyway, good luck with your project the embedded project I am working on has grown over some years now.. to restructure it would be a terrible job :) merci, and thanks a lot for your help It seems that it is quite a ritual. I need to ask in here, to find the answer with the assistant QListview has onle the protected member contentsMouseReleaseEvent. And I thought every Widget can use the normal MouseReleaseEvent",0

"Pardon for the probably very odd question; but what is the point in HTML5 being made if its less strict? Isn't the point of standards to make them more strict to follow a specific set of rules so that browsers read and display them correctly on a universal level? depends on what you mean by ""more strict"" it's important that the UA requirements are completely and consistently defined the authoring requirements don't need to be ""strict"" to achieve interoperability but with the advancing work of XHTML to combine into XML to have further freedom in what a user does, why continue HTML? (these are very basic questions, being asked by a 16 year old interested in the web) I'm not sure I understand your assertion well, XHTML 2.0 is being worked on by the W3C, allowing the combination of HTML (written using XML schema?) to combine with other types of XML (SVG, MathML,ect.) why continue HTML? the goal of the XHTML2.0 working group isn't to ""combine HTML with other types of XML"", as far as I know their goal is to rewrite HTML, and they're doing it in a way that is incompatible with the web ah, i see. Thank you very much, I'm just kind of curious. About 99.95% of the web uses HTML instead of XHTML, so work on HTML is more relevant than XHTML for the majority of users and authors Isn't it also true that most of the web uses wrongly formatted HTML? yes http://triin.net/2006/06/12/HTML suggests about 97.5% of pages are invalid wow. So, what will effectively be the difference between HTML5 and XHTML2? There are basic syntax errors on about half of pages, before even looking at whether they're using real HTML elements and using them correctly http://blog.whatwg.org/faq/ will probably answer a lot of your questions thank you ^^;;; though it's perhaps a little bit biased :) yea i see it has been worked on to try to make it less biased thank you for that",0

"a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2, yo! f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 - just wanted to point out message from Terry Morris offering to help on authors doc I guess I could set him or anybody else up with ssh/cvs access to the source but would rather not unless/until they have actually produced something they want to contribute anyway, see my reply to him on public-html I've been thinking about how to manage people's contributions a bit too I guess it's not worth spending too much time thinking about until there are some actual contributions from others I think the best way would be to set up a wiki page somewhere where people can write their suggestions I'd rather not just let anyone be co-editor with CVS access. I think it's worth waiting to find out how good their contributions are first. aye I know nothing about Terry Morris. What's his background, experience, past contributions, etc? So let's test people out on the wiki first Right. For this kind of stuff I don't know what's the best way to encourage people to contribute. On code projects, I think it's normal to just ask people to contribute patches and if/when they've contributed enough to merit it, give them shared write access to the source yeah, but code is different. For articles, there's the issue of writing style, consistency and other measures of quality that can't be tested programmatically true that if there's anyone with actual spec/article/tutorial writing experience who's also had real web development experience, it might be good to make them co-editor Yeah I wanted Roger Johansson to be a co-editor, but he said doesn't have time unfortunately Anyway, I leave it up to you how you want to manage it. If anybody's not happy with what you decide, we can deal with it then. or they are always free to take initiative on developing an alternative version if they want bbl, gotta eat dinner ok, cya",0

"freeone3000: So what's the problem, again? The QLabel that should be at 0,0 isn't showing up. ""print type(self.layout)"" returns...? qt.QGridLayout <class 'qt.QGridLayout'> rather, but that's its type. Okay, so that much is working. What's type(self)? QWidget Well, main_window, a custom class derived from QWidget and object. Okay. You say the pushbutton is showing up fine? Yes, but not the label. Try using a different widget than a label... a QLineEdit, perhaps. `The requested URL /4.1/qlineinput.html was not found on this server.' Er, meep? Ah. QLineEdit. Sorry. Same. Although the button looks diffrent. Looks different, how? When it's a JLabel, it has a little dashed edge around the button text. Assuming you mean QLabel. ;) Umm... Try self.layout.update() Yeah. Sorry. It sounds to me like the label is actually there, just underneath the button. Well, now the QLineEdit shows, but not the QPushButton. Doesn't much make sense. Nah. i'll probably get on it tommorow... Late here. Maybe show and THEN addWidget? And nu-uh. Puzzling.",0
"danmorg: yes, oracle works ""fine"" under solaris express.. most releases at least... i installed on b47 last night ... EM didn't work properly but other than that the database works fine morning hali, you use EM?) hell: not very often... but emctl config failed in the automatic dbca process during the install... some java process hung i left it for 20 minutes then killed it... perhaps it would have worked if i gave it more time... but i takes 5 minutes on a normal box hm, for me, a don't like dbca :-) it should work better under solaris express.... i tried under solaris express community release... to get the latest zfs stuff what is solaris express? open solaris? i usually use dbca for test and dev boxes.. to lazy solaris express is sort of the solaris 10 beta solaris express community release is opensolaris ""solaris 11"" beta ah. <a href=""http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/solaris-express/"">http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/solaris-express/</a> it's fun to try... all the latest zfs, brandz, zone features and soon crossbow (the new improved self offloading tcp stack) it always fun to try betas :-) and i make fun everyday - apt-get upgrade :-D Hi, I would like to know if there is a x86_64 version of ""Oracle Database 10g Express Edition""? I'm looking for it but until now I've just found x86 version. Thanks in advance. JaVaSan_: unfortunatly not ... yet [hali]: but... Can I install x86 version on a x86_64 system without any problem? you can, can you? in a chroot then i presume? i'm not sure =/ i would not expect it to work hell? I hope my system take care of it.. fedora core 5 and, i think, x64 for XE does not needed, it limited to 1GB of memory.... nothing 32-bit usually work on a 64-bit linux system i think, that 32 bits are enough for 1gb :-) without chrooting and other version of all libraries etc .. maybe. well.. I'm trying to get some advice in fedora channel. for solaris there are no problem, as i understand) solaris does it right from the start :) so does freebsd linux is sort of broken in that area =/ [hali]: what OS do you use? JaVaSan_: most of them :) JaVaSan_: for oracle in general, centos centos linux .. at least for testing and dev [hali]: is it really good for testing and dev? JaVaSan_: yes.. even recommended by oracle if you are to cheap to pay for rhel :) solaris 10 works fine as well fc5 runs xe just fine (32-bit) and at last week i try to install SAP with oracle to solaris 10 :-) they installed fine. but when i start r/3, it say something like ""5.10? wtf 5.10?@ :S",0

"what kind of capacitors would you find in a psu? hmmm...solid or electrolyt? like on mobos? erm i dunno anything specific but they are really big i'm trying to find some high-voltage capacitors sure, they need to be big. i have no idea how capacitors are rated measured in Farad what does that mean? <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farad"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farad</a> it is the measurement for capacity I have an playstation 2 but him freeze during boot dvd-rom what can do ? so like big farads = high voltage? No. check wikipedia, read the article on farad and on capacity. A capacitor has a value of one farad when one coulomb of stored charge causes a potential difference of one volt across its terminals. Make sure you understand what this means. Okay. Hm. you can have thousands of F but only one single V, theoretically. hm, wait a second. Okay - what do you actually want to do with that capacitor? you can compare F to something like Ah for batteries. It describes how ""much energy"" you can store. but, this has nothing to do with the voltage. i want it to be high voltage :o Be sure you know how hight the voltage shall be, and how ""much energy"" you want to store, so how much F the capactior should have and buy one where is the problem?? Stork: dont forget charging circuits and stuff... Well, use a heating or similar, IF it is only a small static you need grounding for. or use the actual grounding provided by your wall outlet, make sure you know what you do, and which is which :-) well hm? have you heard about RF-ID passports? you're german= ? no yes i did. simply throw it into the microwave, that will kill it afaik but i'm fairly sure they will spread well wouldn't it be easier to faraday cage your wallet.. No, it wouldnt, because the ""border officials"" will still be able to use whatever is on that passport and if i am in the next car and have certain equipment with me, i can read that too then. yeah but only if you opened the wallet.. So better just destroy it, it isnt needed anyway. if you fold the antenna back and forth for one hour you're done also. If i get mine i will recode it with some poetry on it. if the rf-id tag was sheilded in a faraday cage you couldn't read it unless i took it out of the wallet :\ ? Theory, yes. but you will need to get it out there everytime you are checked. no problem so at an airport or anywhere your id can still be stolen sure it is a problem well no Airplane check-ins without personal is currently in testing. If someone has you're ID he can get on plane. NO noone will check the picture printed in the passport because noone is even there. sure! presumably you'd only take it out of the wallet when it had to be out of the wallet Okay. What does that help you? Dont you ever want to leave the country or go by plane? I dont think so, and if you ever were in an airport there are lines of people, and while you are checked, i can be behind you reading the rfid-tag because the officer said take the passport out. I then go my equipment in a briefcase or so, and when you passed the control, i simply turn around and go everyone will think ""he maybe forgot something and runs to get it"" or so but instead i never planned to pass the control, i just wanted to read the tag thats all Stork: what you plan is useless not totally, but it isnt something i would consider ""safe"" more safe then not having a tag well no What? more practical then not having a tag Lol What on earch is practical with profiling? Hell, i bet you are a US american, and you see ""more freedom"" in rfid enabled passports? well what if you needed the tag.. and, fuck you, i'm not american What do i need it for? Sorry for that. What do you ever need it for? _if_ your country starts making them mendatory not optional, like here now, you can still go and say you lost your passport, and get a new one working for 20 bucks what if you're in a hurry and you need to check in fast some security agents might be paranoid that your tag doesn't work ... well they wouldn't make it easy for you. you can recode the tags used in german passports with a standard computer, and equipment for lets say around 1000bucks why would you want to recode it? I will never have a working one, cause i do not need my identity stolen. and i'm sure it's not that easy to steal your identity there must be checks against it Check news. where are you from? uk wait a second. sorry i g2g #friends are here tl talk to you laster later i post links in a query you can check them later then re",0

"8b3687499080633e1898fa1dd209ef81, I forgot to push my changes to make it work with idlharness.js changes. Fixed now. Ah, great anyone have a notion off-hand of how common UTF-8 is in Chinese pages? and/or whether Chinese UTF-8 pages actually tend to set @lang? curious about the fact that Firefox defaults to Japanese fonts (which I think is a good thing, encouraging people to set @lang, but I'm surprised it doesn't cause compat problems) 06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6, I think there's been discussions about the Japanese font issues in the Mozilla Taiwan community which handles the l10n for zh-TW. 06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6, I am pretty sure the answer to the @lang question is no. Although Google actually sends it... (the Google part doesn't seem to hold anymore although I am not sureâÃÂ¶) it seems like either 1: firefox is broken for chinese users on lots of utf-8 pages, 2: chinese users don't use utf-8 much, or 3: chinese users set @lang 06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6, when you say Chinese users, do you mean zh-CN or zh-TW or both? both (to the extent that they both use different glyphs than Japanese) Well, I think Japanese and Traditional Chinese share quite a few characters/glyphs. I am not sure though. i think they share a lot more, but still differ i'm wondering because it would be great if other browsers could follow suit in this, encouraging CJK users to set @lang (as opposed to heuristics, etc) 06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6, I just randomly view the source of three pages and see no @lang set. are they utf-8? I am using ja-i18n browsers by the way, and I see nothing broken. l10n yes well, if you can't read chinese, you probably wouldn't notice if it's using the wrong glyphs :) 06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6, I read Chinese and I am a Chinese, I just happen to use a ja laptop so all my softwares are in ja. aad758927f12b95b0cd1961f8dbee690: -CN or -TW? (identifying people by language codes; welcome to the future) zh-Hant :p now you're just not being fair :P is it using a JA font for those pages for you? 06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6, I always want a API to let me know what font the page is showing me T__T. That is, I really can't tell. yeah. though, i sort of prefer pages not being able to tell, so long as the default handling is so wildly different across browsers it's one less thing causing backwards-compat problems that would prevent browsers from converging",0

"2f9d518848f2539fc7f17c1e518648ad: my Japanese handset should have a NetFront based browser, but I've never used it. ah in my case, both my phone and my 3DS use NetFront based browsers however, the latter is the NetFront WebKit-based browser I just wonder if anyone knows any particular tips for it Hmm especially since it has incomplete canvas support it works, but some features are missing some transformations don't work either does NetFront support canvas? yup on my phone it does and it has very little memory it's a feature phone Wow. My handset is like 5yr old so I don't expect that it supports canvas. I wouldn't expect it it's from last year, maybe year before I believe WebKit used in 3DS browser is kinda dated. http://www.nintendo.com/3ds/internetbrowser/sourcecode/ it's NetFront WebKit so yes, probably they package it up and make it easier to port ""Canvas element (einige)"" ""CSS3 (einge)"" interesting. let me check my phone NetFront Browser v3.5 ooh. the Changelog shows the last commit is dated as of 2009-12-21 interesting! So it has the capabilities of... 2 year old webkit Notably, the browser engine of the 3DS is listed as ""NetFront(R) Browser NX 1.0"", so presumably there is or will be a newer version at some point in the future Version.xcconfig says that webkit version is 532.8 that's Google Chrome 4 can't remember what kinda features that Cr4 offered... me neither let me google it HTML5 video and audio was added before version 4 Version 4 has ACID3 fully passing hmm 99d799105c5630cb16b3a7b54e6ae26e: thanks for the open source link btw Ha! at that time there weren't stable builds for Mac and Linux np! ooh websockets they're probably disabled, but there is a folder for them it might just be stubs, though let's see if websockets work :D oh, says they don't when I go to a test shame they were either incomplete or disabled at build-time 99d799105c5630cb16b3a7b54e6ae26e: although it's practically guaranteed to be disabled I'm looking for audio stuff Thing is, unfortunately, it uses WebKit cuz everyone loves WebKit ;) ;( yeah except people looking for old deprecated elements Bah, webkit which it doesn't support 99d799105c5630cb16b3a7b54e6ae26e: woo, 3DS canvas seems to be properly done unlike on my phone where it ignored one of my transforms and hence everything was double the correct height 2f9d518848f2539fc7f17c1e518648ad: woops. mislooked '3DS canavas' as 3D canvas. bah. yeah :/ you know what really excites me? CSS 3d transforms you know what I hate about them? they aren't hardware accelerated seriously, they would otherwise be a really nice way to do 3D in the browser far easier than WebGL paul_irish my issue was closed? http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=104075 99d799105c5630cb16b3a7b54e6ae26e: I just realised if I can render JPGs in the browser I can display 3D images using data URLs ! because the 3DS supports displaying 3D images in the browser and MPO is just two JPEGs concatenated YES! The 3DS supports Data URIs now to somehow make a JPEG with JS",0
"Im watching the df output of my oracle partition... and im importing a 16G dump file, and the partition useage is climbing only by a few K per second.. but oracle is using loads of cpu... whats up? a 16G dump file doesn't contain 16G of data why would you think it did? DDL and DML consume CPU and an import can be CPU-intensive so, what exactly is the problem you're trying to 'solve'? hmmm, okay, so I guess that response was wasted on you Well im wondering why my disk usages is not going up If ive done something wrong with the import department. why SHOULD it??? are your tablespaces auto-extend??? What? The database when running takes up 70 gigs are they filled to capacity and expanding? When all the data is imported on the file system they do in Oracle they probably are pretty empty No its an empty database, and im importing the dump from another system. and how large are your tablespaces now? how large did you create them?? unless they are autoextend you will NOT see disk usage increase not until YOU expand a tablespace by adding a datafile this 'few k per second' you see is proably a log file from the imp session Yes the tablespaces are autoextend. are they FILLED to capacity? probably not until they need to extend they won't Hmm ok and your disk usage won't increase look, when you create a tablespace Oracle creates a datafile that consumes filesystem space but is essentially empty with respect to Oracle when Oracle says it's full then it will extend of course you set LIMITS on how much these files can extend ... because unlimited growth is, well, foolish Â¯/join # this would be a really good time to visit <a href=""http://tahiti.oracle.com"">http://tahiti.oracle.com</a> and read the Concepts guide Most tablespaces are only 10M each, and there around 20 of them. ooooooooookay And by now all of those should be extending should they? have you checked lately? Well its been importing for a while now? so??? Meh I'd be querying dba_data_files and dba_free_space to find out how full these tablespaces are how do I do that? I'd be LOOKING at the desc for each of those tables and figuring it out you'll need an outer join to get usable results if a tablespace is full Ta SELECT SUBSTR(tablespace_name, 1, 20) ""TABLESPACE_NAME"", COUNT(*) ""FRAGMENTS"", TRUNC(SUM(BYTES)/COUNT(*))/1024 ""AVG_FREE"", MIN(BYTES)/1024 ""MIN_FREE"", MAX(BYTES)/1024 ""MAX_FREE"", SUM(BYTES)/1024 ""SUM_FREE"" FROM dba_free_space GROUP BY tablespace_name; that will show you free space in a tablespac Thanks remember if there is NO free space you won't get the tablespace name and you won't have a row for that tablespace this is why you need an outer join between dba_free_Space and dba_data_files SUM(a.bytes) / b.bytes * 100) ""% FREE"" FROM dba_free_space a, dba_data_files b WHERE a.file_id (+) = b.file_id GROUP BY a.tablespace_name, a.file_id, b.bytes ORDER BY a.file_id; let me try that again check your pm the formatting may be a bit off Cheers",0

"/c Okay, guys, I've got an erratic mouse in X on a fresh 3.8 install (yes, I'll be patching asap); I'm currently using /dev/wsmouse and wsmouse protocol, and I've tried PS/2, IMPS/2, and auto - same behavior in all; any other ideas? BTW, console wsmoused is *not* running I've never observed that, sorry. mind the remote sendmail exploit. ayrnieu: yeah, it's not open to the world; thanks :) I've got the patches downloaded, so I'll get them integrated tomorrow wsmouse is always correct on i386 except for serial mice I've seen this before on an older box, and something I did made it stop, but I don't recall what, and google isn't helping NicM: it's a standard optical PS/2 mouse look at the mice options, see if any will help From what I remember, the wsmoused (console) messed it up, and not running it fixed the problem in X (but as I said, that's not it this time) so long as it appears in dmesg as wsmouse0, then use /dev/wsmouse and proto wsmouse Well, it does, and I am... geez, this is aggravating.. does it work with a different mouse? NicM: no, I've tried three different mice that are known good - two optical one plain wheel mouse is this a laptop? Nope hmm. no idea mice are not exactly complicated things Yeah, well, that makes two of us :/ what does it list it as as in dmesg? any odd messages? pastebin your xorg.conf dmesg | grep mouse --> wsmouse0 at pmsi0 mux 0 psmi0? pmsi? you mean pms0? no, that's exact line dmesg|grep pmsi okay, pmsi is a special port for intellimouse try disabling pmsi boot with ""boot -c"" and ""disable pmsi*"" Yay! hmm. i think the phrase ""software hoarding"" should be added to the kill-on-sight list Hehe. Yes. Yes it should. mind you, i know that i sleep curled up on a pile of Win98 CDs. i wonder if that is what they mean I think it is. Kind of like a dragon and gold. yeah either that or you are supposed to deposit small caches of software around the tree, er, house, like a squirrel and nuts to prepare oneself for the long, cold winter Hehe. That kind of describes my flat. ... hahaha NicM: that seems to have worked; thanks! robw810, you may want to sendbug it Yeah, not a bad idea - I'll do it i would try upgrade to 3.9 first, probably Heh; yeah, that too see if it is already fixed in 3.9 I put off ordering my 3.9 cd's this time because of other issues; I guess it's as good a time as any also look at <a href=""http://www.openbsd.org/report.html"">http://www.openbsd.org/report.html</a> I'll wait for the upgrade before I report it; no sense in wasting dev time reporting an issue that's fixed robw810, if you want to make the ""disable pmsi"" permanent you will need to do it with config -ef /bsd after you have booted already done :) good ;_) For the record, the Belkin CA Series 2 Port kvm works fine here; I purposefully left out the fact that I was using it, as I'd already eliminated it, but didn't want it to influence suggestions :) I came across quite a few reports of issues with kvm's and erratic mice there are lots of problems you can have with KVMs This one requires two presses of the scroll lock key to initiate a change, and that doesn't always work the first time, but it's not specific to OpenBSD - the other box is Slackware, and it has the same issue; otherwise, I like it morning!",0

"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-html-cg/2008JulSep/0073.html sugests that the HCG call two weeks ago consisted almost entirely about talking about me Too bad it's a treehouse-archive I think the described ""gain for one segment of the population (those needing alt text)"" comes from having any mechanism that gives a textual description of an image when no equivalent is available (and that requires authors to always write something, and hence to think about alt and (with non-zero probability) write something that's better than nothing); and this particular ""small pain for another (tool writers)"" is specific to the curly-brace syntax and doesn't seem to be a problem in any other proposed mechanism, because the other mechanisms don't add any complexity to the otherwise-pleasant situations where you really do have equivalent text I think the gain is worthwhile, so I wouldn't want to go back to alt being optional; but I think the pain is real, so I'd prefer some other solution that has the same gain without the pain but that involves tradeoffs against the pains (of varying levels of theoreticality) of other solutions, which is not trivial (if it's even possible) :-( k (I guess the desire to be able to distinguish equivalent text from descriptive text, so that <img alt=""equivalent""> can be rendered the same as <span>equivalent</span>, seems like a mostly theoretical concern to me, since in reality nobody distinguishes alt that way, so a UA will have to cope with the indistinguishability anyway) that's basically the argument which is leading me back to alt="""" being optional -- whatever we do the data won't be reliable, so UAs are going to have to do heuristics in all cases anyway, so why not just have the simplest syntax it's not like categories/roles like the spec suggests using now are actually going to be useful ok bed time nn That's far more of a change than just a simpler syntax, since it deprives the UA/user of even descriptive text about the image in practice i doubt that we'd be able to get descriptive text about the image it's not like flickr knows what the images are and in the case of a computer-generated fractal view, it's not like saying ""it's a fractal"" is gonna help anyone same with a webcam or a blind user's photos Even if Flickr just said something like <img alt=""Main photo"">, that would help users tell apart the main photo from e.g. the ""next in photostream"" button where Flickr forgot to put any alt attribute, so it's better than nothing so you want to require that flickr be conforming for one <img> so that the usability of their site is improved because you think they won't be conforming for another one? So once again, we're back at something like notalt=""text that isn't alternate"" if we are assuming we can get them conforming for any images, why would we assume the main image (which is the hardest to get right) would be where they would start in becoming conforming? 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: The evidence seems to back up that assumption, because Flickr does have alt on its main image whereas it doesn't on some of its other images the alt on the main image is pretty bogus right now in most cases i would argue that the flickr site right now shows that which images get alt="""" attribute is more likely to be near-random than anything else Presumably the main image has been there since Flickr first existed, so there's plenty of time for someone who knows 'HTML4 says I need an alt attribute' to have edited the code to generate an alt attribute, while the other images are more recent and nobody has cared to 'fix' them yet ""pretty bogus"" is still better than nothing :-) maybe and maybe or maybe not and when our choices seem to be between ""nothing"" and ""better than nothing"", the latter seems a better choice if it was clearly better i'd agree a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9: Or just alt=""text that isn't alternate"" :-) we could also require that all such images be in a link pointing at the image itself ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: I'm cool with it. You just have to convince public-html actually he just has to convince me, and, if it is controversial, the chairs :-) No, he has to convince public-html so my inbox can get peace and quiet at last ;) i think it's pretty obvious that there are a number of people who are unwilling to move from their positions and who have positions that are unlikely to ever gain wide acceptance e.g. the people who think that even decorative images should have non-empty alt ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: so what text would you suggest for the following cases? a generated image for a fractal explorer; the images in google maps in map view and satellite view; the street view images in google maps; an image uploaded as part of a batch upload with no information; a webcam ok going to bed for real now. will read responses tomorrow. nn a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9: There's an easier solution to the inbox problem: create a new mailing list for alt discussion Even better, create a Task Force for it ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: Oh boy 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: 04:45 on a sunday?

"ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: yeah, it is expert stuff, like writing a text editor with canvas 041f18d4e2e27cd97f4404c2c67cb362: The difference is that it's designed solely for experts and unusable to everyone else, unlike normal canvas which is designed for more normal people but can be twisted by experts into doing crazy things so it is a good logical continuation on that path designed for more expert people but can be twisted by programming demigods into doing utterly insane things The problem is that normal people will it anyway, and they'll make a horrible mess *will use it gsnedders: Do some work on python html5lib instead i do see the problem, but i don't see what can be done about it When 2D-canvas has slightly complex features like getImageData not necessarily returning 1 pixel of data per canvas-pixel, people keep using it wrongly, which means browsers that try to do higher-quality canvases will start breaking, so it hurts everyone uh, there are browsers that do that? and with 3D-canvas people are going to write pages that only work on NVIDIA drivers on Windows and silently fail everywhere else, and it could be considered worse than if the feature didn't exist at all 041f18d4e2e27cd97f4404c2c67cb362: I think WebKit does if you've set some OS UI scaling factor only work on Nvidia drivers, yes, that is a problem with the nvidia glsl allowing Cg-isms unless the shader has #version foo i guess there are other things as well, but that's the first example that sprung to mind i don't like pixels not being pixels. it's so ""let's break every pixel-munging canvas script out there"" Before getPixelData came along, nobody said that canvas was pixels It was just a vector-based immediate-mode API and implementations could do whatever high-resolution stuff or low-resolution-but-with-anti-aliasing stuff they fancied, to make it look good and then they put getImageData in, the knaves! I must admit it's quite useful functionality but it prevents the canvas-is-a-bunch-of-vectors and canvas-is-a-bunch-of-pixels people from coexisting peacefully i hope canvas.width and height at least return the correct pixel amount or that there's some way of getting the dimensions for getting the whole canvas contents canvas.width/height are the size in canvas coordinate units, which are not necessarily related to the number of device pixels in the backing buffer that the implementation uses var fac = getImageData(0,0,1,1).width oh but maybe it's fractional, var fac = getImageData(0,0,canvas.width,1).width/canvas.width There's no requirement for it to even be linear, I think You could have a higher pixel density in the left of the image perhaps because you know the user is looking at their screen from the side, and you don't need so many pixels in the distance :--------| Oh, actually, that's not true Oh, actually, I think it might be It's required that context.createImageData(w, h).width == context.getImageData(0, 0, w, h).width but maybe it could differ if you change the getImageData x",0

"65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: you know, it strikes me that if we just include some data in the encrypted part, then just repeating that information (unencrypted) is actually proof enough that the server is reading the handshake 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, wasn't the concern with that simple echo thingies? well they'd have to decrypt it which is easy enough, but won't happen unless you really are a websocket server 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: you would need to make sure that part of what they echo back is unpredictable right ideally you want at least one thing to be both unpredictable *and* not verbatim well it wouldn't be verbatim, since it'd be encrypted but the data XOR'd with the one-time pad key is all predictable what counts as unpredictable? timestamps? the key itself is the only unpredictable part edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: random data 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: i mean, client sends something like Unique-ID: 312524232362435234521, but in the encrypted part, and the server just has to say that back edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: random data generated by the browser after JS code transfers control 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: but the server's returned data is unencrypted 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: you could do that - then the client is generating two different random numbers right one to be the encryption key and one to be the nonce yup they can be generated from the same single truely random number, it's not like they have to be independent so it's not an entropy drain the other property Adam was trying to guarantee is that both request and response look like random bytes without WebSocket processing but I don't know offhand why it's important yeah 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: they do have to be independent, XORing a value with itself won't be very random btw http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/process-issues/2010Feb/0006.html (W3C Member-only) 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: fair enough edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: well, i have to say, i can't disagree with anything in that e-mail, but i imagine i'd read between the lines rather differently! uhuh :) facepalms at that message also, at the other content of that archive http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/process-issues/2010Feb/0003.html is even more amusing, given the link in that e-mail especially as the accusation immediately after that link is one i would level at the person writing that e-mail! anyway http://twitter.com/patrick_h_lauke/status/9436007749 lol",0

"hi. how can i add a new key+value to a hashtable/dict with a property? i only know of ""value"" as predefined value. is there something like ""key"" predefined? visualbasic hrm ./j ;p sup. vmx: Not sure what you mean. he means he doesnt understand how properties work anarki: yes that's right the get/set are used when: Var = Object.Property; or Object.Property = Var; is there perhaps a nice faq page? a dictionary or hashtable is a class so its passed by reference (i assumes it is a faq) if you want to add stuff to it, just do Object.Property.Add(stuff); vmx: Did you use to be involved with Blender? macke yes? :) are you the blender macke? the same =) world's a small place, eh? =) yeah true. i wouldn't have thought that someone knows me it's been a while, how are ya? should we perhaps switch to a query, as it is a bit OT anarki: thanks, i can't quite follow, but i'll to to get it work with your tips. thanks erm, i'll elaborate oh it doesn't matter, it's not like there's a whole lot going on in here anyway with a property, the get{} set{} things are only used when assignment happens to/from the property so there is only going to be ""value"" sorry iwas away, closing windows as it is raining ;) back now anarki: ic anarki: as use add() it wn't ""set"" it, right? right macke, i'm fine. the only sad thing that i've not much time for blender atm thanks anarki I haven't used blender in quite a while because add is a method of the object the property is set to, not the class the property is in for real anyway I usually check out blender.org for new releases and toy with those for a while, but that's basicly it macke: i'm so surprised that you know me, as i wasn't around at all in the blender world lately, nor i was very noticeable in former times I remember that you and me used to chat quite a bit way back when =) must be at least three years ago, if not more probably more i'm still puzzeling. who you really are, i remeber ""macke"" but not much more well then we're more or less in the same place, I remember ""vmx"" but that's pretty much it ;o) you're german, right? yes were you just a user? or connected to NaN? just a user but I was quite active else i wouldn't know you ;) ;o) do you still have contact to the communtiy or are you just a silent watcher? just watching, lurking around sometimes I get in touch with people like Goofster but rather seldom have you used blender professionally at any time, or always just for fun? I still have contact with svo, Green (he used to call himself rash), desaster, wp, Zarficle, UnNamed (Guiellermo San Romera (sp?)) and a few others I used it professionally for a while a couple of months but I hit the limits of what was possible to do with it at the time, basicly so I dropped it and started using XSI instead i feel sorry for you Macke XSI...pfft blender was always cool, but unfortunatly when it came to professional work, it was more effort than it was worth really Don't, XSI is awesome Valve Software used XSI for HL2...and now i know why the game was delayed a year -_- ah, now i know in which drawer of the community i need to put you not much of a game anyway, much too linear for my taste as i read the names vmx: I know most of those on a personal level btw wp actually came by my place in Stockholm for a week or so last year man, that was so much fun XSI might be alright if they didnt create (and fail miserably) their own UI system I like the ui if they used MFC or something with standard windows controls, it'd be much better why? wp's artworks are really great yeah, wp has grown so much over the years I mean, he's always been good but now he's really really good simple things like the load file/save file dialogs are crap in XSI macke were/are you a alpha/beta/whatever tester of clay? I can't believe he's not working in film or something",0
"edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: so how does you web-dom-core events relate to DOM 3 Events event propagation is different and dom 3 events allow things what for example indexeddb uses that sounds like a bug it's meant to replace dom3events edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: in your events, event target chain is only for node nodes and the chain misses Window, if I read the draft correctly HTML5 covers how Window works already eh so Indexed DB has some kind of hierarchical object model other than Nodes and uses event propagation on them? web-dom-core tries to clearly define how even propagates, and that propagation certainly doesn't include Window yeah, IndexedDB has a tree or list of EventTargets 6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf, HTML5 defines Window and says how it works together with DOM Events 6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf, no need to duplicate that but web-dom-core basically dis-allows Window in the event target chain since ""Let event path be a static ordered list of all ancestor nodes of event's target in tree order."" abarth: why [NoInterfaceObject] for Crypto? 6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf, the way HTML5 defines it makes it work fine doing something else would violate step 1 I agree that if we want hierarchical structures to work in general that section requires some changing that should not be too hard I guess 6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf, btw, the way DOM3Events defines ""phase"" makes it limited to nodes 6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf, I think that's why I limited it, also because I did not know about Indexed DB's usage but that can be changed easily ok, that would be a bug in DOM 3 Events i havn't looked at what idb is doing, but isn't it odd that it's using dom events that differently? I still don't quite understand why events should be merged to web-dom-core 06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6: ""differently"" ? because they are intertwined Node inherits from EventTarget, Document defines createEvent removeChild causes events to be dispatched I still don't get it differently as in not also propagating along nodes; i'll have to look over that spec again when i'm less tired 6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf, ok I don't think it's too important, but it's more convenient to define them together And since they're sort of fundamental to most things, it makes sense to me (and others I believe, you're the first to question it) Hello Anyone here? yes This is my first time here. edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: I'm not really against merging them, but it is kind of strange time 7437f77d5916129f95f7161e1538c0ce: welcome Cool, thnx :) edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: I assume there will be some problems when DOM 3 Events and you events have something defined differently, and both are still drafts... s/you/your/ I thought the plan was for Anne's / Ms2ger's specs to supercede Level 3 for browsers that is and Level 3 to become a Java spec 6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf, the plan at TPAC was that I could go ahead and define ""Events"" and it would evolve in parallel and eventually obsolete the other work (I thought) b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: for Core yes, but I'm not so sure about Events edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: it would make a lot sense to take mutation events from DOM 3 Events to DOM core I do think the way I defined it (apart from some event propagation details apparently) is way clearer edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: but so, your plan is to merge all of DOM 3 Events to Web-DOM-Core? Clear conformance criteria, completely clear on all the details, etc. 6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf, I don't think the rest of DOM 3 Events is ""Core"" mouse/keyboard/etc. should really be defined elsewhere why custom event is ""core"" ? e.g. for mouse events you really want to define them together with pointer-events 6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf, it isn't really, but seemed to small and simple to leave out 6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf, and now serves as a nice example of how to define your own events edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: but you're going to take also mutation events? hmm, though we really want to get rid of those... so I would love that that would be better but IE9 has them you guys have them so? WebKit has them and Opera has them can we really kill them? all of the browsers have different subset of them strongly doubts it That we can kill them are you going to remove them from Firefox after 4 ships? I mean if that is a yes I can wait with adding them to the spec because I'd love for that to work and I don't have a deadline here Even if they are not quite interoperable, everyone will have some content that depends on them in fact, I'm leaving for three months soonish :) the impression I got at TPAC was that nobody in fact was planning on killing them maybe a couple but not all the only change I had the impression we might be able to make was to make them asynchronous since no one likes them, we really should try to get rid of them. if that doesn't work out, then it just doesn't and we need to keep them forever making them async seems like a win but we haven't even tried 6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf, alright, I will wait with figuring out mutation events I really wasn't looking forward to that anyway :) edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: :) it can be,hmm, interesting to define DOMSubtreeModified properly",0

"042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427: thanks 042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427: I created the element with document.createElement(""audio""); can I still remove that from the DOM? I tried fooAudioElement.remove() with no luck (using jquery) did you put it in the DOM? I don't think so, I just created it, set the src, and play()ed it ah hmm ok, stopping it from downloading is kinda hard you can drop all references to it and wait for GC to kill it, but that's unknown delay ok. should I just put an empty <audio> element on page load and then just change it's src and such? you could insert it into an inactive document so that its owner document is an inactive document, which will stop the download, but that's rather obscure k what are you actually trying to do change songs can't you just change the .src and call load()? so once a song changes, I don't want it to buffer the old one I'll try that works, thanks",0

"69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, does [6.11.9 History Traversal] occur on all page loads, even if I type straight into the URL bar? yes it is invoked as part of the navigation algorithm So is popstate fired on all loads? no only if there is state to pop Only if the state to pop is non-null? I could set the document pending object to null as part of the algorithm. hold on eab22ddafe9ed99f3735e412bf7ae3e3: ok, here now. looking... eab22ddafe9ed99f3735e412bf7ae3e3: popstate only fires when an entry in the session history is activated eab22ddafe9ed99f3735e412bf7ae3e3: which only occurs if the specified entry is a state object or the first entry for a Document eab22ddafe9ed99f3735e412bf7ae3e3: but yes, it fires at least once per Document load s/but/so/ my statement earlier was incorrect eab22ddafe9ed99f3735e412bf7ae3e3: sorry about that! 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, sorry, was afk for a sec. I'm not totally clear on this: If we load index.html and then go to index.html#foo, do we get one or two popstates? Once for the initial document load... one I see. you get one for the page load And if we go back to index.html, we also don't get a popstate, because index.html doesn't have an associated state object. right er well actually... looks closer :) actually yes, you do you always get a popstate when traversing to the first entry in the history for a Document is relieved. Oh...interesting. not sure that's entirely sane but it's what it says Me either. I've been dispatching popstate whenever we dispatch onload, and also when you go back/forwards to any history entry. That might be easier for developers to deal with, since it's somewhat consistent. the original intent was to only dispatch it when hitting an entry that has been pushState()d i am not sure why we dispatch for the initial page load I think because you want to know when you go back to it? i guess, yeah yeah, that makes sense So it treats the first history entry for a document as one which was pushState()ed to. right that makes sense i guess maybe? :) :-) so the only entries for which you don't fire a popstate per spec are those that were added due to the hash changing (they get a hashchange) I see. That might be a little confusing, because clearstate does clear those. yeah, that was a recent change iirc or at least, that wasn't my original intent thing is, if we do fire popstate for everything then authors are going to have to distinguish the state=null-because-first case from the state=null-because-hashchange-will-fire-next case and that's probably harder than just dealing with those two cases Hm... I'm not yet convinced that matters. Wouldn't they listen to popstate alone in that case? * rephrased: If they just ignore hashchanges, do they care about differentiating between them? if they don't distinguish them, then each time the user changes the hash manually, the page is going to reset to the initial state Hmm wonders how this would change if we had a setState() function. Then you *could* associate state with the initial entry. true but it's easy enough to remember the state for the initial state i mean, what they _should_ do is if state is null, or if hashchange is called, just base the state on the url i guess we could call popstate always do any other UAs implement this yet? That's how I've been imagining it working. That way you can bookmark the page and it'll do the right thing. I'm not aware of any other UAs working on this. try e-mailing the list and seeing what others think of it Will do. if it's not too late for shipped implementations, i can change it to just always fire popstate my contribution to the web: events firing all the damn time. :-/ Okay. I'll try and send out an e-mail soon. I have a few other things in there, but they don't require the Author to parse the spec for me. :) i guess nothing i've done with events is as bad as mutation events, still eab22ddafe9ed99f3735e412bf7ae3e3: k :-) Thanks, 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e. np wonders why adding features to the web platform feels like a continuous exercise in damage mitigation it's like trying to build a sandcastle under a waterfall lol.

Yeah. I'm only just beginning to get into this, but...I don't envy that. eh, the sad thing is i enjoy it i'm a sucker i guess :-P :) I need to go catch my train now. Thanks again! later!",0
"When I do something like \\.\a: that does the \\. refer to? Your local machine? I don't know. and didn't we implement a working page file dialog? I remember using it. I guess I will need to try it again, so I can close this bug. Oh, yeah, something for pagefile would be helpful. I don't want to give my ros install like a whole bloat of RAM, when it can happily swap. ;) Well, the ""happily swap"" may not be perfect, but I've made ros swap before. RAM is better than swap It's much faster Thanks Captain Obvious You're welcome ;) \\. and \\? must be similar (or the same) Well, swap is okay, if the stuff being swapped out isn't needed. And I wonder, what a bare running ros (no apps) needs 60MB for. uh, it shouldn't what's telling you that? WaxDragon - If I give qemu less then about 62MB, ros usually frezzes with ""MM: Out of swap space"" or so. ... when starting a cmd and a taskmanager or so. ... or two cmd. Are you running a debug build? Yes. It needs memory for the debug symbols Can't it page them in as needed? (I use the bootcd-*-dbg.rar from svn.r.o) hehe They would need to be ""swapped out"" first for them to be ""swapped in"" There is a bug filed on the memory usage. They can be swapped in from the .exe on the disk. They aren't modified in RAM. Modern OSes don't even load the complete executable into RAM, they load the relevant pages when the program jumps there. Yay for them. :D mostly changing int = void * stuff You can either find someone else to fix it, or fix it yourself. Or the third option no one even talks about. What is the third option? Deal with it symbols are necessarily in RAM, because you can't read from disk if a BSOD appeared (storage stack is not usable anymore) ;0) hpoussin - hmpf...",0

Now you have a sky background behind that. The large 2D image's pixels can be changed. So you need to render it after the sky. However you can't render the ImageData with composition without first writing it to a massive canvas the same size as the 2D image then getting the ImageData perform the manipulation on the large canvas then rend er changes back to that canvas.

Also the whole idea would be not to make tons of extra canvas tags. It doesn't seem like it should be necessary? not tons, it's like one more canvas element. and you don't need to use imagedata at all just use the regular api to modify the ground bugmail: [Bug 11500] The actual effect that triggering the command will have.

Unless you're suggesting using tons of 1 pixel drawRect calls. Basically all this allows is a putImageData that allows composition and not just a direct copy over of the pixel data. no i'm saying you can use the path api to blow the holes in the canvas but sure, you can use imagedata too just putimagedata the pixels to the canvas directly and overlay the canvases in the final rendering, so that several of them are showing instead of manually compositing it all down to one layer eww I needed the pixel data to work with still. I'll have to write up a larger explanation later. It just seems like a flaw in the API That along with this: http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=11566 solves all the basic problems I've seen with working with a single canvas 11566: warcraftthreeft, P2, NEW, Image should have getContext(...) just like canvas Actually if you could getImageData the actual imageData and not a copy that would be cool too i don't see why multiple canvases are a problem hmm no wait but anyway, we might well add drawImage(ImageData) in a future version, it just doesn't seem like there's a pressing need for it 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, because it's a hastle for game programming to design a rendering engine outside of one render target. Having to take a design then add tons of extra render targets is a roundabout way to solve it. Also for what I was talking about I still need the ImageData anyway so there's a cost in continuously creating new ImageData objects. (I mean to get the pixel data to work with it) you don't need to continuously create new ImageData objects just have one and putImageData to the ground canvas It's like telling someone programming in flash to make tons of swf projects and overlap them transparently to get a parallax scroll :\ i really don't understand why a rendering engine designed for the web would assume that the render target is a <canvas> rather than assuming it's the Web, with as many <canvas>es as necessary no, it's not you're not programming in canvas you're programming with html the whole API canvas is but one tool in a large toolbox it's not the toolbox don't limit yourself artificially :-) I'll have to think about this more.

I am sure the user is authenticated, I checked with a PHP script (using Apache .htaccess BASIC AUTH), thanks <a href=""http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/2.3/javadoc/javax/servlet/http/HttpServletRequest.html#getRemoteUser"">http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/2.3/javadoc/javax/servlet/http/HttpServletRequest.html#getRemoteUser</a>() IMHO you will never get a sense-full value from searching on google, it seems that Apache does not forward the http header to Tomcat? what do you mean ""sense-full"" value? something you can use is there another way to obtain the REMOTE_USER server variable without using the request.getRemoteUser() method? chrono: i'm not sure, but I would doubt it. Why do you want to use it anyway? I am using Apache's .htaccess for basic authentication, and need to get the username (not password) so i can do something like ""hello someone"" chrono: dunno. i would try to make the basic auth without apache directly with tomcat and see if it works. according to this test you'd know where to dig dvayanu: yeah, i tried that with tomcat by setting the <security-constraint> in web.xml file, the method returns the username... so you probably have to search for mod_jk options/settingsa hmn, ok, thank you chrono: posted it to the user-list though? not yet, was still searching for an answer",0

"hsivonen_: really unuseful error message: it told me that on line 60000, when it hit the </body>, it had some unclosed elements hsivonen_: which ones? what lines did they start on? needs to be less good at procrastinating a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554: You need to get better at procrastinating, so you can direct it towards tasks that weren't worth doing anyway probably similar to http://bugzilla.validator.nu/show_bug.cgi?id=440 if the people who comment on sam's blog would instead take part in the actual official mailing lists, we might drown out the nonsense on public-html with at least semi-sane discussion given the following sentence: The DOM attribute relList must reflect the rel content attribute ...can you come up with a way of phrasing it whereby it means the same as that, but by only removing characters, you can get it to mean the equivalent of: The DOM attribute relList reflects the rel content attribute What's that s doing to cause trouble? mostly, it's grammatically required if you can get an s into the first one that works too me gets confused by the question wonders why 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e needs that the former is what i need for the full spec, the second is what i need for the author-only spec but for QA purposes i really want to keep the second a pure subset of the former <span class=""main-spec-only"">s</span> :) you mean author-spec-only? that unfortunately doesn't satisfy my ""keep the second a pure subset of the former"" goal :-) You'd have the tag in both specs there is only one spec Yes and one tag, which hides stuff from the author version And you do the opposite with this hiding from the main version is what i'm trying to avoid because then the specs aren't a pure subset of each other and QA becomes a huge pain because you have to always check things in two specs You need a script that magically fixes grammar issues, while removing RFC2119 keywords :P ""must always be in a state where it reflects"" hm, interesting approach tweets his feelings I don't think it's possible to do without looking silly a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9: so i fear types /invite a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 into his #twitter channel 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: What do you think of that, so far, BTW? effing awesome makes twitter usable used the IM interface till that died Is it real time, or do tweets come bunched together? having the same interface for msn, yahoo, aim, icq, jabber, freenode, moznet, w3net, quakenet, operanet, and twitter is pretty spectacularly awesometastic. a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554: it polls every 2 minutes or something like that That sucks a bit. feels real time since i only check irc every 2 minutes or so :-) and so far people haven't replied anywhere near that fast :) sod it, i'll use an author-only class but it's for grammar only! 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: What do you use for IM? bitlbee 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: How does that show who is online? I guess you need to manually poll using ISON? when they come online they join the channel when they are away they get -v, and when they are not away they get +v It seem a bit like trying to shoehorn things into IRC how so? i mean, it is, but it seems like a near perfect fit Well, most IM clients have proper ways to note whether people are away or not without misusing some other feature for it if irssi did /away polling, i'd see if bitlbee supported using that instead but i prefer seeing the mode changes it works well and it works in all im clients er, irc clients a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9: i can;t use the class actually, because then it means you must use css to view the spec <del>s</del> :P uh huh one option is to go through and change all the uses of the term reflect to be definitions instead of requirements and move the requirement to the definition of ""Reflect"" but that would be a huge pain A one-time pain? all of this is a one-time pain the easier option is to hide the entire paragraph and use a domintro thingy instead another option is to say that all attributes that are omitted reflect by default One-time as in it won't hurt if you write new sections, since the pain is only rewriting and not writing. yes i dunno if it's a good idea though plays around with BitlBee Heh realizes everyone is away on IM ok problem solved i'll just hide all these paragraphs and rely on a summary table that future ian will write heh does future Ian have a lot more time on his hands than existing Ian? actually yes future ian has a whole week in august for writing summary tables",0

"I'm wondering if we have documented somewhere the cases in which the existing parsing behavior in IE differs from what parsing algorithm in HTML5. nope but there's a lot of them the main one is that HTML5 already results in trees, and IE doesn't b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f: OK, I knew about that main one. When I was at Web Directions in Sydney, I was asked why the spec doesn't just document the IE parsing behavior. I mean, in the cases where there are specific differences between parsing behavior in browsers. (and outside of the problem that IE doesn't actually use a tree) I got the impression that generally the spec was written to be as close to IE as possible but no closer some things it does are just weird, and other browsers have better behaviour some things will have been changed for better future extension, I would imagine but obviously, keeping a list of all IE's behaviour vs. HTML5 behaviour would be prohibitively expensive because you'd have to be able to reverse IE's algorithm exactly to do that b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f: I see What I said to the person who asked me is pretty much the same as ""some things it does are just weird, and other browsers have better behaviour"" but I couldn't think of any specific cases I'm sure I'll get asked again some time, so I want to educate myself about at least what some of the known cases are. <select> parsing I believe is weird in IE I'm sure Hixie will be able to mention a few OK Hixie called HTML5 ""mostly complete"" at the beginning of 2007 some of the differences will also be in how document.write() interacts with parsing http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1155195074&count=1 a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: also http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1138169545&order=-1&count=5 and other posts with titles starting ""Tag Soup"" b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f: thanks",0

Has anyone ever heard of NFS deciding to only host on one interface after being restarted? :\ Because it sometimes works And sometimes doesnt And I wanted it to forcce clients to use tcp only So I have messed with a lot of rc's and don't remember what all I have changed :P So I am led to believe I made it do this hmm sunrpc and rpc services like nfs seem to always listen to all interfaces here last time I wanted to restrict them to a single interface the software didn't even allow it heh that was in the 1.6 days though but I only run rpc services on boxes in the LAN behind the internet firewall Yeah See here is the situation using TCP with NFS as well, but I just use -T option on clients, server would still accept UDP clients, I never tried to make it refuse UDP ones Well see my clients are os x boxes So if it uses -t on the server then they can't connect I wanted it to force Because you can't mount with flags from the finder ;) But I have a 100Mbit rtk0 and a 10Mbit pcn0, and the 100Mbit is on the lan and the 10Mbit is connected to the internet So I want nfs on the 100Mbit :) Grr hmm if 10mbit is connected to the internet router then 100mbit should be used for lan interface by default I guess ifconfig should tell which address is associated to each, if one with LAN address is the 100mbit one I don't see how the 10mbit one would be used when attempting to connect to another LAN box I've got it so that this UPS can either be a uhidev or a ugen, depending on which port I plug it into",0

"hello, i have multiple canvases in my webpage, and i am using one to create a linearGradient object, can i draw this gradient only to the canvas i used to created it or is it a ""standalone"" object that i can draw on any canvas? create with canvas i mean the context of the canvas of course :0 8fac8ccbd99bd25f4326fc6687b13661: I've not actually tried moving a gradient from one canvas to another, but I'm pretty sure that it's tied to the 2d rendering context that it was created with. This means you wouldn't be able to transfer it between canvasses. Have you tried it? 9a6651e9db26914297c1814554fd5ceb, i see, thank you! no let me try That's always the best way to see if it works. My gut says it won't, but you never know ;) thats true but astonishingly (is there such a word? :[) it works, i can draw a gradient on any canvas not just the one i created it with Wow, that's interesting i can make a little pasty with the test code, just a second Sure, thank you :) that is the code i used: http://pastebin.com/u3R8HRSd The spec states This is because CanvasGradient objects are canvas-neutral âÃÃ® a CanvasGradient object created by one canvas can be used by another, and there is therefore no way to know which is the ""element in question"" at the time that the color is specified. So I guess it's expected 8b3687499080633e1898fa1dd209ef81: Good old spec. Seems weird that you have to create it from a specific context though 8b3687499080633e1898fa1dd209ef81, i should read the specs more :) :) 8fac8ccbd99bd25f4326fc6687b13661: In all honesty, the spec is definitely the best place to go to be sure about a feature. I should have looked there first, really. :P hehe next time, i will look into the specs and if i still can't figure out stuff i come here to ask :P thanks again! :)",0

"AryehGregor: <span sandbox> seems like it would be foiled by the attacker just starting his content with '</span>', am I missing something? zcorpan_: Fixed <title> a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9: I thought the idea was you'd escape the user's text before outputting it so you'd get <span sandbox>&lt;/span&gt;... That's the idea, but then that's the idea without @sandbox as well And we all know how well that works Without @sandbox the browser wouldn't interpret the tag's content as (restricted) HTML that it should parse and render Assume an author who doesn't actually understand sandbox, he's just heard about it and wants to use it If the author wants to display 'safe' HTML from users, today they'd have to find a large complex library that they don't understand, like html5lib's sanitizer or a zillion other libraries, and then pass the content through it and print it out With <span sandbox>, it'd be basically the same except they don't need a sanitizer library, they just need a good old plain HTML escape function, and the browser is responsible for proper sanitization (Most XSS holes seem to come from people forgetting about escaping entirely, and letting unrestricted user-generated content leak out, and we can't stop that; but the idea is to make it easier when people do want to properly display content safely) I'm wondering if the apparently simplicity will lead to more people trying to do it (and thus more people doing it incorrectly, instead of not doing it at all) The idea here seems to be ""Author tests with markup, notices nothing renderering, goes to figure out how to do it properly, does it properly"" I think someone suggested making the browser delete the content if it sees an unescaped "" or ', so they should very quickly discover that they need to escape the content That looks very similar to how well-formed XHTML is supposed to work, yet we get YSODs and the escaping is easy YSODs triggered by user-generated content are usually not due to the author forgetting to use their serialize-to-well-formed-XML function, they're due to the serialize-to-well-formed-XML function being really really hard to implement perfectly correctly Correctly escaping 5 ASCII characters is far easier doc="""" only requires you to escape one (two for correctness, three (four?) for XML), which is why i kinda like that idea (I think I don't really mind XML draconianness as a concept, I just mind it when it's coupled with very complex rules (like forbidden ranges of characters and forbidden attribute values and forbidden strings of characters that are otherwise plain text etc)) <span sandbox> only requires you to escape one (<) too, I think (...in order to avoid attacks) ""omg interwebs collapsed"" is an interesting bug tag",0

OSX doesn't include the cvs command by default f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: it does if you install everything that came in the box f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: Leopard includes svn, too yeah you might have to install the dev tools (everything includes the Developer Tools) I installed the XCode tools earlier today I need to come up with nice names for WF2 floats nice names for code and nice names for UI floating point number with optional exponent? float-exp yeah, sorry about the mess there not sure exactly what we should do with those hopefully the forms task force will finish soon and we'll be able to finally merge WF2 with HTML5 (hahaha) oh hey, only two more days til the ""forms tf internal charter review period"" ends oops email, mimetype-list and charset-list have fallen through the cracks more entries for the wiki page more code to write anyone want to lay odds on the review period being extended because everyone forgot to review the charter? i give it about even odds 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: saying it here is tampering with the odds i guess so though i don't know in which direction :-) I feel tempted to restrict charset-list to charsets that are implemented and sane but I guess in theory I should scrape the IANA registry I expect unexpected craziness in the email datatype i think i scoped out the craziness of the e-mail datatype by picking a strategic entry point for you ah. excellent. thanks oh. cute. dependency on IDN and, therefore, Punycode ah yeah, can't help you avoid that, sorry. minor nit: I think you should say ""addr-spec production"" instead of ""addr-spec token"" yeah, good point. can you send mail? i'll totally forget it by the time i get back to wf2. 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: email sent ta I haven't seen any comments on public-forms-tf about the charter since the telcon at the end of october. I don't think anyone has reviewed it :-) f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: yeah, exactly it's not really clear to me that anyone on the task force actually really cares, to be honest nice to know the task force working as expected :-) no comment 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: is it intentional that 1. is a valid HTML5 float ? it isn't a valid WF2 float hmm. .1 is also not a valid WF2 float i doubt any of the differences are intentional they were mostly based on whatever i found when reverse engineering stuff it's likely the wf2 stuff is based on what i thought would be good, vs html5's stuff which is based on legacy implementations makes sense since WF2 is a submission format yeah however, for consistency, .1 and 1. could be made non-conforming on the non-WF2 side i'd rather make them conforming on the other side, if they work but yeah (especially .1) I'm not sure if that would help authors, though yeah I guess they are now as good as they are going to get and authors just have to deal with the discrepancy with leading/trailing zero omission what are? authors? :-) oh, the formats i'd like them the same if we can but i'm not sure we can the wiki list of microsyntaxes keeps growing 31 already. I'm going to add 2 more and that's ignoring the inputmode attribute, because magically, it is actually possible to construct with RELAX NG list{} heh 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/2007OctDec/0241.html âÃÃ® more mailing list fun in due course, I should write a by-reference spec for these 33 microsyntaxes a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554: actually it would make a lot of sense for ABNF to support namespaces a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554: since it's a programming format b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: if you want oddities in the microsyntaxes in HTML 5, take a look at my emails on public-html (just search the subject for something like detailed spec review of common microsyntaxes) 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: agreed the biggest problem with ABNF is that it is REALLY freaking hard to write ABNF in a way that defines error handling that's the main reason i don't use it much a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554: I don't want oddities. I just think that the RELAX NG datatype library for HTML5 should have a spec (i used it for the event-source stuff, and even there, where i was TRYING to define error handling, i still made mistakes, and ended up having to duplicate the work in prose anyway) precise enough to let someone write an interoperable implementation in another programming language without looking at my code i've found some sites that use an ""adx.js"" library anyone know anything about it? 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: in reply to the one on the same list yesterday regarding error handling, I got told basically that I could do it in another spec, and they wouldn't do it a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554: cool, a license to write a replacement http spec from the http group a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554: sounds like a plan!

"discovers that if he makes a Jabber client send namespace-ill-formed XML to a group chat, then ejabberd propagates it to all the other clients and they detect the error and disconnect and when they reconnect and rejoin the group, the server helpfully sends the past messages to the newly-joining clients, which breaks them again Hahahaha.

"f239f2bafff63896b07d52ac5d9aa017: in theory the spec already says what encoding to use for the query part f239f2bafff63896b07d52ac5d9aa017: see the url part of html5 (somewhere in section 2 iirc) looking... so it says the encoding should match the encoding of the document or script (in case of the Worker) looks If I read it correctly :-) 2.5.1 and further it says to use the ""script's character encoding"" which is set by the ""Create a script"" algorithm which in the case of a worker is invoked in step 3 of section 2.5's algorithm and is always set to utf-8 so in the worker case i guess the answer is always utf-8 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: sorry, I'm not sure I follow. Lets say we load a Worker and it has a http header that sets charset. So we decode the script using that encoding. Doesn't it become a ""script' s encoding""? so when this script tries to open XHR (for example) shouldn't we encode that url with that encoding? I guess I'm looking for ""create a script"" algorithm... ah, ok, I see it now. in a worker spec, ""Set the script's character encoding to UTF-8. (This is just used for encoding non-ASCII characters in the query component of URLs.)"" So basically all URLs inside scripts should be encoded UTF8 Thanks!",0

"Machiavelli claimed that, as a ruler, it's better to be feared than loved. What do you think? i have my own intelect i dont need to follow others maybe this was true for him Every human being does :P but not for everyone True Do you want to know how he explained his claim? i dont care cuz such things cant be generalized to all human kind It's not really a generalisation - more of an observation of how people behave towards monarch and rulers When a ruler is loved by his people, it's the people that grant him their love But when one is feared, he instils fear into people with his own actions Machiavelli argued that it's better to depend on a resource that you provide yourself, and not something that is given to you by others After all, if a ruler is neither feared nor loved, he is quickly deposed oh gosh i didnt notice the ruler in the statement yes i believe what he said is totally true",0

"does anyone know how the document.all hiding works in Mozilla? a bit http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/DOM:document.all does not exist do you have specific questions, or are you just looking for a comprehensive spec? :) I wonder if document.all returns some quirky object that ""booleanizes"" to ""false"" or if it's some other trickery hsivonen: yeah, they never did reply to http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2007Nov/0274.html and whether ""booleanizes"" is an actual JS concept or specifically added other trickery sends a proposal to solve the inline/block problem but it basically requires us to stop allowing <ol> and co in paragraphs I believe it hooks gets of document.all and returns ""undefined"" if it's in a ""detecting"" context interesting hmm http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/dom/src/base/nsDOMClassInfo.cpp#7889 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, you could make <ol> and <ul> imply <p> around them too as I read that, it makes document.all exist if you try to get .length, .item(), or something that matches an id from it, but not exist otherwise that file seems to beat HTML 5 in bytes yeah, it's got a lot of icky DOM magic built into it :) edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: but then you could never use <p> in <li> or <hx> in <li> etc sorry, what I meant was that <aside> TEXT <ol> is like <aside> <p> TEST </p> <ol> right, that means not allowing <ol> in <p> yes, but you marked that example as non-conforming <aside> TEXT <ul> <li> <p> TEXT to be more specific oh, or that because of the <em> on the line before? an <ol> is either inline or block if it's inline, it can't contain blocks if it's inside a paragraph, it's inline if we allow <ol> inside paragraphs, then <aside> text <ol>... looks the same as <aside> <p> text <ol>... (assuming we do implied <p>s) (i think doing implied <p>s around only elements that can't be blocks would be even more confusing) <aside> the way people use IMHO doesn't seem humble at all most of the time heh that's completely wrong and you're stupid, IMHO <aside> TEXT <ul> <li> TEXT <p> TEXT why is the <p> non-conforming with implied paragraphs ? if we assume that <ul> can be inline, and if we assume that implied paragraphs wrap all potentially inline elements in a run, then the <ul> in that example is inline and inside a paragraph. Elements that are inline can't contain blocks. ok, my proposal (on top of implied paragraphs) was to make <ul>, etc. block elements that's what i said. remove the ability for <ol> to be inside <p>.",0

"http://blog.ioactive.com/2012/02/ssl-traffic-analysis-on-google-maps.html is pretty interesting would SPDY make that more complicated because it all becomes a single stream? edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: only if you were actually using more than just google maps at a time, as far as i can tell edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: if i understand correctly, the only real solution is to pad all requests and responses and make them on a strict schedule edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: hard core encrypted channels just send continual noise at the max bandwidth and when they want to send data they replace the noise with the data edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: assuming a good encryption algorithm, my understanding is that you then can't tell what's being sent edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: of course you can still tell a lot e.g. that there is a connection, so that both sides exist, which is an issue e.g. in war situations 8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21 would know more sounds pretty fascinating I wonder when w3.org will go TLS-only traffic analysis is really hard to defeat at least without cover traffic isn't it essentially impossible without cover traffic? Microsoft research paper writes ""XmlHttpRequest"" o_O 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: i try not to say ""impossible"" :) fair enough i think Tor tries to defeat traffic analysis without cover traffic but it's unclear how successful they are don't they use other people's traffic as cover traffic? aren't you the one who says ""the impossible just takes longer?"" i mean it's not as good as a continuous stream, but... 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: yes, they mix traffic from multiple sources, but they have problems because that traffic can be removed statistically its more like noise wow, interesting so, then you get into shaping the traffic by adding queues and delays etc there's a whole literature about it i'm sure is it even possible to design a system that does not have these flaws? can you measure anything other than amount of data? timing oh, how fast the connection is? how often requests are made, etc? for example, if a site sends a ping every 2s in one mode and a ping every 2.5s in another mode, even if they're the same size, you can tell which mode the app is in just by looking at when the packets are sent I guess that can tell you quite a bit the general topic here is called ""side channel attacks"". q.v. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_channel_attack power consumption is another one that that page mentions that is, size plus timing seem like vectors that will turn out to be pretty unique e.g. you can tell what's going on based on how much power you are pulling -- if it's just idling, it'll use less power than if it's doing heavy computation also in the case of TLS communication on the web there's things like DNS requests, the IP address of the communication's destination, etc e.g. you can tell if someone is logging in on big sites because they get redirected through a separate login service even if the data is mixed in with noise like i was suggesting earlier, you can also learn things by watching what happens if you flip random bits in the stream since the receiving end might just discard the noise rather than verify that it wasn't tampered with (encryption typically avoids this, q.v. integrity) encryption systems, i should say encryption itself doesn't",0

"mimo is 'crap'? why, doesn't it work what are the best cheap wireless cards? Encore sux too much but i saw lg ones seens to be pretty good on range. Fr3DBr: the chipset usually gives the range/quality. I'd say look for the cheapest atheros-based cards. hmm here its HARDER to find atheros/orinico orinoco* only what i can find is : RealTek / Marvell usually and for sure RealTek is better lol Marvell's known to be buggy that I don't know i have a radio on my house realtek, although I know their eth cards/drivers are stable, aren't a hallmark of quality and my neighboor is like 20 meters backwards and like 8 meters higher than my house there were funny comments in the freeBSD drivers about realtek a while ago his pc is like 2 walls inside the house behind my radio and using a encore card he cant even see my radio signal when i try the lg one it works perfectly lol something to the effect that realtek is the absolute worst marvell is even more lol I had seen soem whitepapers from marvell on wireless ]which had lots of sense showed the work they did on sensitivity/TX power for better wireless performance; assuming that that's been implemented in all their products I'd expect good RF performance from those rr-: the actual phrase was something like ""this realtek crap redefines the meaning of low end"" ""the DMA is so bad - it doesn't do scatter/gather or work across some boundaries so the CPU needs to spend so much time assembling the data in the proper way that the DMA is useless"" it was just really sad probably not for realtek, which i assume is laughing all the way to bank",0

"Hello Age?! Hi Age Why are you so pushy? Haha 19 Sorry Cause I'm sick of people on here I'm f 20 You ? That's no excuse to be ageist F also Sorry lol. Bi? Ehh, it's complicated Explain please I'm bored and sick of dudes from india For the longest time I thought I was completely straight, even though I've always accepted that yes, some girls are hot But then And then halfway through the end of highschool, I realised I had the hugest crush on my best friend, but I wasn't exactly sexually attracted to her That went away Go on lol Halfway though first year of college, I have a dirty dream about one of the girls in my class Yum. And now I'm just plain confused Haha I'm bi. I went through same shit My dorm roommate was bi. She dared me to eat her out I did. Loved it. Wow You're very daring. It took a while lol She walked naked around dorm all the time. I wondered why I got excitef Till I finally talked about it Would you say you're equally attracted to both sexes or lean towards one more than the other? More towards boys. But something about a girl gets me soaked. Even before I got confused, I think it's a fair thing to say that on average, girls are just plain hotter than guys haha I 69 with a girl. So hot. Omg Does it work if you're different heights? lol Duh. Girls shave. Smell better. Thongs r sexy. I get wet for g strings Heights? Lol Hmm Like if one girl was a lot taller than the other. It wouldn't line up right ... Not true. It works. My roommate licked my ass. Best feeling ever Lucky you. Must be nice having a roommate like that A lez roommate? At first no it was awkward! I was confused too She's more bi I guess idk what she is I meant more about the part where she licked your ass haha No one has ever done that. It blew my mind. Cool U? I'm as virgin as one can possibly get lol Dirty mind, untouched body. Wait really Yep. Describe dirty lol. What goes through your mind Everything. Like?!? Gosh, you're so easily excited haha I don't even know where to start Just explain I got peed on. More wild than that? Oh no, I guess not I win :) Well I've considered it, but wouldn't want to get peed on haha How about piss on someone Yeahh, but not in a sexual way. Mostly as a prank if they piss me off lol Still hot. I peed on my ex face. He peed on me. Crazy. lol My friend dared me to poop on his chest. I said fuck no.",0

I looked but didn't find that specific bit, prolly cause I was looking for canvas stuff me needs something like that do draw our dashboards if I can avoid canvas, the better! browser/components/tabview/ drag.js and ui.js? not sure what you need exactly but you can build a lot without using a canvas (css transitions, animations, transforms etc) cool. that's what I'll do then! I can go without more stuff to learn ;) :) the inspector itself is also standard html, right? mostly. it's a mix of xul + html but xul is not that different alright - thanks! 90567b1e4960f50f5e604261cdc5a080: hum - you worked with tabcandy - do you know if somehwere there's a ""standalone"" web page that I could use as a starting point? standalone? a starting point for what? something like tabcandy.html that worked outside the chrome (does this make sense?) um, what do you want it for exactly? to examine how it's built? I want to start with tabcandy, take a look on how it works, use the classes I'll need for my project and start modifying it, understanding the way it works oh ok, hm. tabcandy is pretty much tied to the outer browser, getting it to work standalone requires some work you could look up the tabview source to see how it's done and start from scratch :) that sounds l;ike a plan thanks",0

"Anyone got any recommendations for the best bang for the buck right now in terms of motherboard, cpu, and video? This will be primarily a gaming computer. Building a win computer from scratch with budget around 900 Flashpass, do you need a monitor? or just the box with parts box with parts keyboard, mouse, and monitor not included ok one second I have two <a href=""http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814130020"">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814130020</a> in SLI mode (cost me around 190 for both) they do amazing in tests. Play BF2 on 1600x1200 THE BEST with full HDR, also steam on full graphics. that's good for video <a href=""http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813135203"">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813135203</a> Works with the dual-core systems without having to flash the bios (many other brands have bad reputations) this is a great sli motherboard that is easy and GREAT, comes with backup bios so you can never kill it! It's performance was better than any other board I have tested cheep too just to be clear, SLI is when you're using two video cards to render half the screen at a time? I would reccomend a AMD64 3800+ X2, you can get them for about 260$ SLI is 2 video cards that work together to share processing. Even those ""saver"" cards are amazing gs was the cheep version, but funny thing is the chips came out even faster than they expected. the eVGA ones are considered the best I have those and can run any game I want on full graphics and can not lag! That all looks pretty good, the only thing is I want to sort of keep in the name brand area for mobo The only thing I'm missing is an agea PhysX processor LOL So you bought 2 of those eVGA cards? Ya, that's why I got ECS because its a good name Yes they are sweet I have that motherboard and both of those cards in right now So you'll need 2 pci express slots? That motherboard has two x16 slots The mobo doesn't seem to be getting good reviews though I dont know of any mobo that has good reviews I have tried abit, asus, ecs, msi, gigabyte, and more the best seems to be DFI and ECS DFI if you are overclocking and testing ECS if you want a stable system what socket does X2 run on? but fast 939 cool it's 64 or 32 bit. forward and backward compatable. so if you ever have to upgrade your os in the future you have options This system is fast Even on just one of the cores I can run a game and still have power left over This board looks pretty nice: <a href=""http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813131568"">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813131568</a> In reality they have some problems parts tend to fall off of them and the heat pipes are cool but for some reason that model likes to leak its a mix of water, alcohol, and some other type of something. it evaporates and goes to to top, cools at the fins, and then falls. They are great usually that specific board had problems as I did a install for a friends computer. maybe it was just that one-in-a-million but..... we just returned it but that's not even a SLI one you could not use 2 cards in it it says you can And the reviews for it look pretty darn good oh wait yes it is out of 500 something people nm, it's just farther away lol usually they are side by side I don't want to put down your board or anything, i'm sure it great. But I kind of want to go with the odds and support because this won't be mine and I can't always fix it up If it works then it might be worth it no matter what you do please get a good power supply Antec is one of the best Ultra x-connect work too Sounds like I'll need one with all this power lol I'd have antec over just about anything Alright I need to start taking notes lol if you get a crappy one it will blow and maybe take out other devices with it Yeah i've definately seen that haha get 2 of these, if you want 2028MB of ram <a href=""http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/searchtools/item-Details.asp?EdpNo=30260&sku=ULT31088"">http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/searchtools/item-Details.asp?EdpNo=30260&sku=ULT31088</a> Or get 2 good 1gb chips or something. Remember i'm on a 900 dollar budget lol I think I might start him with one good 1gb stick we are already up to 600$ exactly lol so it's 100$ for a antec case with 550W psu At newegg? 700... 200$ to pimp out the rest Between newegg, tigerdirect, and fry's so what else do you need? 30$ dvd burner from newegg Yeah i'll need like 100 bucks for a decent sata hdd 150 after rebate 500GB ata-133 from fry's 7200rpm And should i use stock fan/heatsink? that makes it 800 or 9 whatever haha that's his max, I'm pushin it I like the thermaltake fanless 103, but stock works haha dang Wish he gave me a 1500 dollar limit, then this would be fun! coolermaster aero 7+ works for me ;) I'm thinking somewhere around 200-250gb should be plenty So any mobo with socket 939 should support X2 processors? Fanless 103 Cooler (Sockets 478, 754, 939) 39$, eww price went UP lol 59$ 200gb sata 300 from fry's no rebate needed awesome ill buy it for someone for $30 charge ;P frys is pretty close to me right next to me ;) I was mainly going after the BEST rather than your price limit. You might have to go single-core and get something like a AMD64 3700+ (still rocks) Flashpass, many motherboards, asus even, say they have support but you need to upgrade the bios to get that support and that's stupid because you need to buy a amd64 3000+ to flash the bios to get yoru x2 installed so wtf is their deal? if they make a 200$ performance motherboard that ""supports x2"" why the hell do I need to upgrade it to make it support? bas customer service and engineering. not all 939 support it the ecs one does, for sure, I have tested. is there some way to know aside from testing it out? maybe user forums does asus have user forums that are open Ah a buncha reviews said it worked fine so that's good ok if not do you have a cpu that you can use to flash with and does that motherboard come with a spare backup bios? No, and I dont know lol but enough people said it worked without effort for me to take that risk Out of 500 or so that's pretty good odds So you think the X2 technology is worth the price difference? oh do you need to do software too with this setup because windows xp has this nasty WGA stuff now that actually makes people honest and also punishes the honest people because many people have gotten their copies banned I'd reccomend linux",0

"69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: re: use cases for time element, your March 2009 summary email lists automated adding to a calendar, restyling dates for user conventions and encoding output of input element unambiguously. Is that still accurate? ref: http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2009-March/018888.html 1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f: yes, though also add a less-dubious-than-abbr solution for microformats and microdata encoding dates hixie: ok. IâÃÃ´m curious about year and year-month. for adding to calendar, what about future dates which are not yet confirmed? eg 5 year plans do you have an example of a page where it would be helpful for the user to be able to add a five-year plan to his calendar by clicking one thing on the page? personally IâÃÃ´d like to add dates for future events IâÃÃ´m organising (Web Directions) to my calendar, but adding a day when theyâÃÃ´re only accurate to a month seems like false detail. current workaround is to add for the first of the month then try to remember what dates are set and which ones are vague (these are on a private planning site) wouldn't it be more likely that you'd add those to the calendar before making a web page 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: there are several of us planning, plus others who need read/write or just read access. IâÃÃ´m making a list of dates in the planning site, then weâÃÃ´re adding dates to a shared Google Calendar. However IâÃÃ´d also like to do this from HTML you just want to add the dates? not event names, locations, etc? (that way IâÃÃ´d only have to make the page with event info inc. microformatted dates, not add the events to a calendar plus make the page) i don't follow 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: IâÃÃ´d like a list of events in a planning site, plus to be able to add them to a calendar. current process is create events in calendar plus create list on planning site. with microformats I could just do planning site then one-click to add to calendar (the less time in iCal.app the better :/ ) sup? oops sorry wrong channel :P 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: for the 2nd point (automatic formatting to follow user conventions), in Japan itâÃÃ´s common to write dates with kanji separators; 2010Ã?Â¥8ÃÃºÃ 20ÃÃ³â¢. using time itâÃÃ´d be possible to do this automatically, but these also apply to year-month and year dates (eg weblog archive titles) 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: for the 3rd point (encode output of input element unambiguously) that should apply to year-month input too, no? 1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f: re your example, i don't see why you'd need anything new from <time> if you're going to use a microformat or microdata. For example, vEvent is based on dates as used with <time>, not months or years, iirc. 1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f: even for multi-day or -year events 1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f: regarding your 2nd point, good to know. 1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f: regarding your 3rd point, i don't know; do people ever print the output of type=month in that way? the main use case for type=month is credit card expiry dates, but those get pretty printed easily as far as i can tell no need for <time> for that 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: print the output? pretty printed? as in, sites just do printf ""%04d-%02m"", $year, $month or vice versa it doesn't need anything complex 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: aah and might even actively not need anything complex, i dunno... how do japanese e-commerce sites echo expiry dates? what do japanese credit cards look like? 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: IâÃÃ´m pretty sure IâÃÃ´ve seen Japanese ecommerce sites that have the year as 2-digit sure but do they have the kanji sepuarators? 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: yeah, some Japanese credit cards have the expiry date as eg 10/15 (with English âÃÃºMonth/YearâÃÃ¹ printed faintly above) but then thereâÃÃ´s the whole Japanese year format thingâÃÂ¶ (wikipedia-ingâÃÂ¶) 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: found it; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_era_name 2010 is actually 22Ã?Â¥ (the 22nd year of the Heisei era). in long form today is 20-8-2010 or 2010Ã?Â¥8ÃÃºÃ 20ÃÃ³â¢ or Ã??22Ã?Â¥8ÃÃºÃ 20ÃÃ³â¢ (the Ã?? being the first kanji of Ã??ÃÃ Ãª or the Heisei era) actually it would be useful to use <time datetime=""1935"">ÃÃ²?9Ã?Â¥</time> (the ninth year of the Sh?Ã§wa era) as even Japanese people have trouble with this system outside of dates theyâÃÃ´re familiar with. IâÃÃ´ve got a free iPhone converter app for this :) itâÃÃ´s still used for eg driverâÃÃ´s license DoB so not a historical thing yet 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: IâÃÃ´ll add this info to the wiki page, want me to also email the list about it? bbiab 1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f: i likely won't see it if it's just on the wiki page :-)",0

(Are they on <h3>s or something?) they look at whereever you double click, and find the first element above it to have an id which will typically be an <hx> first element child of body doesn't know if it'd be too distracting to have a little edit link beside each possible annotatable location s/edit/add/ ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: i think having it non-intuitive is ok, the people who should be editing it can be told what the ui is it's not hard to explain multipage is back up but for some reason the annotations aren't showing up ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: as far as i can tell, the middle click of a link does give the warning well, error 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: Not in Opera 9.2 probably a bug in opera (Also the Safari icon doesn't work in Opera) if you have any suggestions for changes to the section status options, let me know afk lunch 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: it would help if the annotation UI highlighted the part of spec being annotated.

"Hmm... Darnit, everyone's gone. What's going to happen if filter-mappng has a URL mapping of say `/pattern/myservlet' And the web app actually contains a directory with `/pattern/myservlet/' Then, is the filter invoked for say domain.tld/myapp/pattern/myservlet/somepoor.jsp? What if `/pattern/myservlet/somepoor.jsp' is also a URL-mapping to yet another filter? <filter-mapping><filter-name>hello...<url-pattern>/pattern/myservlet</...> <filter-mapping<filter-name>bye...<url-pattern>/pattern/myserlvet/somepoor.jsp</...> Actual structure of web app: /path/to/mywebapp/pattern/myservlet/somepoor.jsp what's the relationship between Tomcat and, say, Tapestry? Or Spring? Divorced. Nothing at all to do with each other? both apache projects.. I need to take a class just to understand the terminology Well, Tapestry is a framework as for Tomcat is a web container that adheres to servlet/jsp specification to the teeth. So... Tapestry is a higher-level system that would run under Tomcat? More like on top of Tomcat. I've never played around with it so don't take my words for it. Tapestry is a framework for building webapps. Those webapps run in a servlet container, such as Tomcat. wsmoak_: okay, whew, that's what I thought, but couldn't find definitive info Make it ""web container"" to encampus JSP as well. :) so off i go to start down the Tomcat tutorials, then maybe look into Tapestry thanks folks! majorly helpful Try Strut as well. Tapestry is one of many frameworks... JSF, Struts, Spring MVC, the list goes on. Yeah, I've noticed Tapestry and Spring appear to be the ""next big thing""s Ya, try to read on all of them see on the surface what each accomplishes and how. Then narrow down your interest and go with it. Well, I just lost my job, so I've got a little time for a new challenge to lead me into a new job No, Iran is going to be a next big CABOOOM. What was your last job? kismet_, Sorry to hear that. thanks, Uviz. I was hired as a Level 1 Programmer, told I'd be working with .NET Framework, but turned out they're integration project required Perl, which I had NO experience with. Ugh, and this is MY fault? So they let you go? Yep WTF! But they hired you based on your knowledge of .NET, not Perl. It was so awkward because no one I worked with had any idea what programming and web development was like or what it involved Hah, so why they didn't fire the rest? What a whacky company. Yeah, they were just clueless, someone had apparently told them they would want .NET I mean, it happens time to time that people get hired for a certain position which later on turns out to be something else but they tell you to go ahead and learn, for instance, Perl. I did the crash course in Perl, and was finally getting around to working demos, but not fast enough for their percieved needs. That's just aweful. Did you move to a new location because of your hiring? Nope, but I did have to put all my Personal Web Dev Clients on the far back burner, and now they all moved on with other developers Were you doing ASP/PHP for your own clients? Yep And Javascript/Ajax, and general XHTML/CSS and web design If you had clients, why did you move on to a company in the first place? Well, only had 3 clients Consulting beats being someone else's slave. So what made you decide to learn Servlet/JSP? Full time job + Web Dev biz on the side was rather stressful and hard to pull off I understand. I'm doing the full blitz, hoping to conquer all the major platforms and environments, so my demo apps can overshadow my lacking a degree on the bright side, i did basically get paid for about a month to learn Perl, which is pretty frickin sweet That can be a plan. Well, winning a $300 million lottery ticket is fricking sweet to me but everyone's standard differs. I'd been working as a Pharmacy Tech for 4 years at a crappy pharmacy chain, so the ridiculous short-lived job was still a MAJOR step up in the world. =) I really want to know what the hiring manager asked you in the interview that convinced him you are the right candidate despite the fact you probably had mentioned to him of your lack of experience with Perl. They had no idea Perl would be part of the plan They figured that was my job to work out I mean, either a position requires certain criteria that the candidate MUST meet or else... And the rest of the team new Perl? s/new/knew LOL, hell no. 2 of my coworkers were the bosses who only knew ""Management"" and networking to interest people in buying into their franchise, 1 guy was the major tech guy who really only knew networking really well, and the other guy was just a repair tech When you say networking, are you referring to network engineer, network admin, or network programmer? So they really didn't know what Perl was, didn't know it was a fundamental tool for integrating with a new system heh the bosses i mean networking socially/financially, setting up entrepreneurial sales meetings and such Uhh, so I guess they wanted some Perl guru to come and do all the hard works and they take a wrap for it. take that! Hahaha, that's funny, sales meetings, keke. They just wanted to buy someone who knew all the stuff they didn't know. perl is diaper, you only use it once.. Exactly. Which is actually a LOT that they didn't know Good thing you got out. I feel like I should have fired them, frankly lol I dunno, I took a shine to Perl, the whole CPAN thing, and all those great pre-built modules. The syntax and those sigils and dereferencing... YIKES kismet my suggestion would get awesome at one tech and pretty good on a handful of others Haha, Perl is just a glorified version of assembly... Syntax wise. except when you write assembly you cant just 'hack it' like you can with perl yeah, i'd like to pwn java and .net, and hone Perl, Python, and PHP thats a fair whack id suggest you pick one java or .net i'd almost pass up ASP.NET, except it is in demand cause they dont often cross over (except c#) Or web services so be forced to learn a bit of both. yer python is handy but you can only have so much of that active at any one time ive built systems in all the above mentioned but i only work in php, java atm and some python ""and some of the technologies above mentioned."" :) lol Assembly FOR LIFE. yeah, so java is my least familiar as far as web applications, so that's the first stop I remember the first time I saw SPARC assembly... I wanted to cry. Figure I'll put together some Tomcat stuff, then look into the frameworks Tomcat stuff... mm'mm. I know this guy from the place I work, I gave him MS Office 2003 Pro the other day, he hasn't talked to me since. Microsoft breaks up friendships. cause he hates you now? or he's engrossed? I dunno, maybe he's sick or too busy. Ok, I gotta go to bed. G'night... Nice chattin, thanks for the sympathy =) night nacht thanks guys! good night",0

"Now that we have the ability to generate a copy of the spec with static annotations, I wonder what it would take to combine that with the dynamic annotations in the WHATWG copy so that the script only needs to check for changes in the annotations since the last commit that would significantly reduce load time on the spec it would actually increase load time for the spec itself the bottle neck is the javascript performance, not the download time on another note, maybe we should have people pass a test to prove that they have read the html5 spec before they're allowed to propose text- or process- level changes to the spec or wg. f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: in your browser maybe :-) f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: in safari, the JS runs nice and fast crap i marked the last checkin editorial but it affected html5 parser implementations I don't like using safari for reading the spec because it lacks essential features I need for reading it efficiently 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: that would seriously cut down on the number of proposals, if enforced 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: What kind of test, given that people are unlikely to retain even a small part of the whole spec? a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9: open book f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: like what? wonders what he's missing! So more like a ""Read these sections"" in practice then :) like Find As You Type without having to press cmd+F or '/' to start searching a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9: no, there are plenty of questions that require a clear understanding of many partso of the spec to answer. only Firefox has that feature. My repeated attempts to convince people that we need it Opera have failed :-( and Safari's find feature has an unacceptable delay f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: putting a finger on a single key is too much? I find it more than acceptable in return for being able to have single key shortcuts a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9, I hate single key shortcuts, and yes, being forced to press a single key I never remember to press is annoying 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, if I find some time this weekend, I'll see if I can take a look at the annotations script and merge it with the static version cool 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, how does status.cgi work? Is it backed by a database or static files? backed by mysql would it be possible to get a copy of that database, status.cgi and any other files used for the annotations? last time I tried to do anything with the annotations script, my attempts failed because I couldn't substitue status.cgi with static files and so the script wouldn't run properly oh, maybe I don't need to. I can just set up a local server side script that passes off all requests for status.cgi to your copy, thus bypassing the cross-origin restrictions http://damowmow.com/temp/status.tar.gz thanks can anyone remember why we block manifests to only contain URLs with the same scheme?",0
"so this idea of mcarter's is great but the cookie idea is only going to fly if the same port is used and if we ignore the scheme change and the authorisation thing isn't going to work unless we massively complicate the handshake to also include a 401 step naturally, it has to be same-port (barring a mechanism like access-control) http://www.w3.org/mid/g4a63l$tkg$<email/> some people are surprisingly rude on mailing lists (probably including me) I have a question concerning sessionStorage and localStorageâÃÂ¶ it is said, that a storage event is fired whenever data is changed to all HTMLDocuments that can access the data. How can a sessionStorage have multiple instances that affect each other? Whenever a new window is opened, the session storage area is copied but will no longer affect the original. 6cba5ee1cbe5c1742070b04dd14dac30: generally, it can't 6cba5ee1cbe5c1742070b04dd14dac30: hoever 6cba5ee1cbe5c1742070b04dd14dac30: say you were on page A in a window 6cba5ee1cbe5c1742070b04dd14dac30: and you go to page B at the same domain in the same window, and the browser keeps page A around, just in case you go back 6cba5ee1cbe5c1742070b04dd14dac30: now when you hit back, the page A is shown back on the screen without being reloaded 6cba5ee1cbe5c1742070b04dd14dac30: so now, if you changed anything in the sessionStorage while B was showing, the event will be fired on A when you return to it wonders if any browsers implement RFC2817 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: I see, thanks! np 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: Maybe a note would help to clear this up? eventually there'll be a whole introduction section for the storage apis actually i guess there already is. but it will probably be longer. One more question: when an HTMLDocument is affected, but not active yet, are those events kind of held back until the HTMLDocument is active? yeah it should say that somewhere can't see where right now but it's there somewhere, unless i removed it accidentally at some point so what HTTP method should we pretend to use for web sockets GET? SOCKET? has no idea what he is talking about heh ooh. the WHATWG blog dashboard has a new appearance ""there are 107 comments in your spam queue right now"" all real spam deleted deleted the 7 articles apparently advertising holidays in Spain b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: I though I just deleted them thought b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: Maybe we both did :) did you delete the offending users as well? f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: in the article case, yes. In the comment cases, no. notes on web sockets: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/notes mcarter: see ^ i used GET instead of OPTIONS, to surprise unsuspecting servers less the cookies and authentication headers are going to be difficult to use in practice unless the same port is used (i'll throw in some stuff to make them be sent even though the scheme differs) i intend to drop the rfc 2817 ideas, since regular TLS is good enough i think and nobody seems to do 2817 anyway i want to have the server echo the origin and the socket uri as part of the handshake to (a) check for cross-site access being ok and (b) check that the host header is correctly interpreted (if the server just echoes them without checking them, then too bad) anyway, if anyone has comments, drop them here, i'll read them in the morning bed time now",0
"some of the imperative pseudo-code/prose in the HTML5 spec is rather difficult to follow you have to be a native en-GB-x-Hixie speaker that could be awkward it's rather frustrating, as you can almost represent all this stuff with regular expressions which would be a lot easier to check that you've got it right I'm stuck on the ""get an attribute"" step if you read carefully it shouldn't be a problem the code gets rather long and fiddly you don't have to follow the specification you just have to ensure that A > algorithm > B is identicala 73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642: Charset sniffing? Yeah, I didn't like doing that either actually, A > B > C where B can be English prose or C or Python, etc. right the charset sniffer seems to parse attributes on close tags, eg. </foo bar=""baz""> yeah tokenizer does that too does the tokenizer parse them then throw them away? yes phew :) what I meant about the spec is that the description is actually lower level than the code it's easier to implement a high level spec with low level code than the reverse. hmm isn't the spec at the same level? charset sniffing needs to be done at the byte level I mean it's very imperative the spec is longer than your python implementation, for example and much harder to understand so how can it be done in the same way being as exact as it is now? if it can be improved I suppose it should be done that's what I'm trying to figure out using regular expressions would be an obvious place to start and it's easy to see how that could be done for most of it for example: <![^>]*> that's the regular expression to match <!DOCTYPE...> and similar junk and skip over it similarly for comments: <!--([^-]|-[^-]|--[^>])*--> defining it using a regular expression means that there is no ambiguity about <!--> vs. <!---> vs. <!----> start tags and get attribute are a little trickier, but I think can still be done to match the beginning of a start tag: </?[A-Za-z][^\s><]* (or end tag, as it has an optional slash) the resulting regular expressions could just about be pasted straight into lex or perl or whatever however, it makes it harder to introduce <!--> as comment very easy, just change the regular expression much easier than editing the prose actually, the expression I pasted before is a little bit too strict if you're going down that route you have to define what subset of regular expressions and such... <!--([^-]|-+[^>])*--> would be better prefers the prose actually that's not a problem, many many specifications use standard subset of regular expressions or BNF oh well :) regular expressions also encourages a particular implementation which isn't necessarily good meeting hmm, I think the current prose is more biased towards a particular implementation whereas regular expressions can be implemented directly, or used as specification for hand written parser ahah, regular expression for attributes: [\s/]*([^<>][^=\s/<>]*)[\s]*=[\s]*('[^']*'|""[^""]*""|[^\s<>]*) it may look like line noise, but you don't have to be an en-GB-x-Hixie speaker to understand it :)",0

I think he's a developer e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0: Web developer or IE developer? not sure it's not very nice from MS to come with this I think as they haven't really contributed to any discussion and haven't acknowledged all the steps we made in the direction of their implementation mostly if there was a difference the IE way was picked, even when it was quite insane it seems pretty late to object but I guess they haven't been following closely to object in such a fundamental way I mean but I also think ""please make the spec toothless"" is not a valid request in any case it would certainly be nice if they said what's incompatible and how to change the spec to make it compatible they said they don't have the resources to do extensive testing, and that they are unwilling to make any changes at all to their existing code both of those seem like they would conflict with the idea of documenting the issues in detail the vision document is quite funny I'm not sure they have real compatibility issues in mind, they just say any change might be a compat issue it talks about HTML parsers being expensive for mobile devices where a parser is one of the least significant things in a browser in terms of being expensive as if parsing was the hard part also, it's not like HTML parsing is more expensive than XML parsing (besides the fact that XML might be more complicated even, with all the DTD crazyness) in either code size or runtime",0

"planet: Auckland Web Meetup 2009 <http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/roc/archives/2009/09/auckland_web_me_2.html> bugmail: [Bug 7679] New: editorial: ""The following content attributes must not be specified"" applies to authors but is hidden behind class=impl. It would be helpful if each state listed the attributes that are allowed to be specified for that state. <http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html-bugzilla/2009Sep/0461.html> there surely is some spec somewhere that defines how to parse mime types mimesniff defers to HTTP, but HTTP says nothing useful, it only gives authoring conformance criteria are you saying that parsing can't be derived from the ABNF? what is the mime type when the input is ""text/ plain "" ? and where is that defined? The type is ""text"" and the subtype is ""plain"" The trailing whitespace is LWS where does it actually say how you derive the type and subtype from the string? I see grammar tokens ""type"" and ""subtype"" but nothing that says that they have any relationship to the actual type and subtype. what's the mime type if the input is ""text//plain""? media-type = type ""/"" subtype *( "";"" parameter ) I think that's as clear as it can be those tokens are opaque identifiers the above is exactly equivalent to: and ""text//plain"" doesn't partse according to the ABNF, so it's invalid xxxxxxxxxx = aaaa ""/"" bbbbbbb *( "";"" ccccccccc ) Yes, but only if you behave as a spez nazi (tm mplilgrim I think) how do we know that hte ""aaaa"" and ""bbbbbbb"" parts have the semantics of ""type"" and ""subtype""? ah so you're saying http doesn't actually define this and we have to guess ok we know by using our brain i agree that we can make educated guesses this has nothing to do with guessing i'm just looking for an actual definition also, i understand ""text//plain"" is invalid. i'm asking how to parse it, not how to validate it. it has to do woth not insulting the reader by repeating obvious information it's a parse error yes i know it's a parse error that doesn't answer the question of how you parse it what's the type and subtype? is the type ""text"" and the subtype ""/plain""? and where does the spec define this? btw, being precise isn't insulting the reader it's respecting the reader ""Linear white space (LWS) MUST NOT be used between the type and subtype, nor between an attribute and its value."" - sounds like ""text/ plain"" is invalid; does that mean it can't be parsed into a type and subtype? The spec doesn't specify what to do with invalid input. That's it. it's clearly invalid, yes ah, ok i guess i'll have to define it in html5 then sigh yes, go ahead, waste mor time, and write another 50 line algorithm defining how things work to get interoperability is not a waste of time the waste of time is specs that leave this stuff undefined (i am still sometimes surprised as to how few specs define enough to actually result in truly interoperable behaviour, given how common it is for people to screw things up at all levels) (especially given the security implications of UAs doing their own thing each time) wow, i can't find a single user agent that interprets MIME types according to the way 338c23e8eafc19ec9236404deac0bef4 said the spec implied they should be parsed so far tried wget, safari, chrome, opera, firefox, and IE8 please be more specific. are there any other user agents that support text/html? changes: hixie: Make it clear that spaces around the value of type='' on <script> are stripped first, and that the types are compared literally. (whatwg r3909) <http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html-diffs/2009Sep/0161.html> i.e. that process text/html differently than other content? Please be more specific in how they behave other than ""Julian said"" that treat text/html like text/ html if your point is that they accept invalid input: this is not news and I didn't say it's illegal to do so no, i'm testing valid input So, please be more specific so far no tool i have tested has treated ""Content-Type: text/ html"" as equivalent to ""Content-Type: text/html"" they all treat the former as an unknown type why should it yes, and that that's good; the former is invalid you just said it was valid or rather no I didn't you just said the spec said it parsed as type=text, subtype=html which surely is the same with or without the space No, I didn't It appears you are confused about what I said; maybe that's my fault. The ABNF is clear about it, and that was my point you said that the ABNF said how to parse, right? and the ABNF says that that parses as type=text, subtype=html No, it doesn't The ABNF does not allow whitespace there the spec says that there is implied *LWS between all words I see I misread your example. I saw ""text/plain "", but it was ""text/ plain "". So no, that is invalid input ok see this is why we need a spec that actually says what it means and says how to parse things so we don't have to try to guess ""The type, subtype, and parameter attribute names are case-insensitive. Parameter values might or might not be case-sensitive, depending on the semantics of the parameter name. Linear white space (LWS) MUST NOT be used between the type and subtype, nor between an attribute and its value. The presence or absence of a parameter might be significant to the processing of a media-type, depending... ...on its definition within the media type registry."" So it says that. so you're saying that that sentence means the grammar is to be treated differently? ""Except where noted otherwise, linear white space (LWS) can be included between any two adjacent words (token or quoted-string), and between adjacent words and separators, without changing the interpretation of a field."" It's all there. oh the authoring-level criteria there is what they meant by that? And yes, the way the ABNF work depends on out-of-band informaion. This is something we are fixing in httpbis. These are not ""authoring-level criteria"". It's regular spec text. could you please make it so (a) we don't have to read between the lines to work out how to parse things and (b) you define how to parse everything, valid or invalid? I think you are confusing yourself with that distinction you made up some time ago. (a) you don't need to read between the lines, just switch on common sense and i think you're making things worse by refusing to acknowledge the necessity of that deistinction distinction, even (b) the WG discussed this multiple times, and there's no consensus for doing so (need to run now) ""switch on common sense"" is ""read between the lines"" in the spec world because different people have different ideas of what is common sense for example, i think it's common sense that a format needs to apply Postel's law, instead of pushing that responsibility to user agents, where differences causes security bugs",0

"you beat me to taking it off channel is your problem occurring on a different computer than the one you are ircing with? i'm not in any hurry so take your time this comp rootnoverify (hd1,0) i can't believe how many connections i have reported by netstat -a makeactive do you have something like label windoze? yes title Windows 2000 then that those lines then chainloader +1 # For booting Windows NT or Windows95 #title Windows NT / Windows 95 boot menu #rootnoverify (hd0,0) #makeactive #chainloader +1 # For loading DOS if Windows NT is installed # chainload /bootsect.dos yes dunno about windows 2000 i had it running at one time or another, long time ago rootnoverify (hd1,0) THAT is for your SECOND hard drive ithought thre was something like mapto or something no yes do you have makeactive? yes before the chainloader +1 did you reinstall grub after 2000 was installed on hdb1? yes not grub-install? grub is loaded to (hd0) i went into grub, and told it the fololowing ok good enough root (hd1,2) just saying i wouldn't use grub-install setup)hd0) setup hd0) gar so your /boot partition is on hd1,2? you know what my fingers are garbling i do it is also my / no shouldn't be bah works 90% of the time your /boot and / should be separate partitions possibly, but more confusing not for me i'm taking a linux class that it should come up at least a few times again why debian doesn't do /boot separately by default i started that way i have been using linux for over 12 years took me a long time to understand security for on one separate /boot partition has many benefits access yes only root can mount you could put /boot on a flash drive gah but anyway, back to your problem how do i fix my dilemna? dilemma :) i've had windows on any drive before just because i could i've put windows 2000 at the very end of an 80 gb drive on hdd i've had lilo and grub on hda's mbr or fd0 got an idea, but it's weird swap drive cables wait do you have a combo of ide/sata drives? no hda hdb do you have an add-n ide pci controller? hdcor hdd is cd no ok so simple setup it's a compaq desktop no, leave cdrom as hdd they don't make the blasted things screw-up-able which also means they make it so you can hardly upgrade them right, so simply ide0 is hda/b and ide1 is hdc/d but grub is a little wierd like that, compared to lilo if you have any previous experience with lilo.. grub doesn't go by hda/b/c/d it goes by first device second third.. you said you had error 15? or was it 22? no.. i got as goofly char error so can you boot linux? yes install windows first? thing so it's booted both before you have linux on hda? nope.. anything on hda? hda1 fat32, winme oh hmmm hdb1 ntfs win2k where's linux hdb3 / is 2k the only thing you can't boot? map to_drive from_drive yes i don't recognize map left winme ot of the picture so far ok load grub.. typ help it shouldn't be needed, to_drive put hdb on hda, do clean install of 2k there, then move it to hdb install grub on new hda with current settings does that make any sense? or put it this way can't clean install vital data there when installing NTish OS on ANY drive, it ALWAYS writes over the boot sector and MBR of the first drive according to the BIOS which is probably hda or hd0 just did another MBR write. what... wrote grub weith the map command to hd0 again brb",0

"Hey all. hi... i have 2 divs inside another div... the first is width:auto and i want the other to take the free space the first leaves... is this possible? There is no space left horizontal space the parent div has fixed width, the first inside auto, and i want the second inside width to be the difference between the first's width (auto) and the parent div space width Block elements take up all horizontal space they can. by default floats also? No. And nothing floats by default. if i dont set them float i cant put the second div next to the first Yes, you can; and you'd need to know the width most of the time If IE isn't an issue, you can do this in the way you probably think you should. Otherwise, pick a width and apply it. the problem is that the first div is going to change it's width dinamically how do i put two non floats one next to the other? ya, done i used zindex and put one div over the another",0

"word This new computer I've put together is driving me insane. what is the problem I was getting MACHINE_CHECK_EXCEPTION at random....which I gather can be absolutely anything. So I went about finding spares of all the various parts and tried them out one by one. The only thing I didn't have was another CPU...and I tried everything else with the same result. So I figured it had to be a bad CPU. This old computer I've given to my sister is driving me insane yaaar did you run memtest on it overnight or even 24 hrs So I get my brand new boxed Pentium D today and slap it in the board. Now, instead of getting an MCE midway through OS installation, I get........ flyback: memtest came up fine. but just in case, i bought two new sticks and tried them out. same result. worked fine when I had it, now reboots semi-randomly... flyback: as i said....i've now replaced every single part in the computer. yaar what temp on the cpu and what brand power supply mmm, memtest for a while sounds like a plan yaaar: God's an AMD fanboi :P flyback: woops, i missed a line. i meant to say that now, with the new cpu, instead of getting MCEs I just get no video output at all on boot flyback: don't have a temp on the cpu, but it's a retail cpu/fan in an air-conditioned room, and this was the first time it had ever been turned on....so i don't think it could have been hot enough to matter by the time the machine was supposed to be POSTing flyback: power supply is a no-name. but i tried my neighbor's really nice thermaltake one and it still gave the MCE ...that was before the new CPU arrived. BIOS update? ? yaaar no name are shit but if you tried a decent one then I dunno did you try other ide cables, and other optical drives yaaar: tried updating the mobo bios? tjousk yeah you start with memtest also flyback: but with the original CPU it at least turned on... LSD`: a)I don't see how I can update my BIOS with a machine that won't POST. b)I don't see how the BIOS update would let one CPU run but not the other yaar it could be a bad board flyback: i've tried a different board as well. note i mentioned i have now replaced every component in the machine. flyback: but also note that this board at least turns on with the other CPU yeah but flakey board will sometimes do that mabye you aren't mounting the heatsink right or something yaaar: the board not posting with the Pentium D could be due to a BIUOS not supporting the P-D in which case a BIOS update might correct it that's true also flyback: it's pretty hard to miss with the new pentium heatsinks....4 holes, push until click... LSD`: the original chip is also a P-D LSD`: the only difference is the old one is a 2.8 w/ 1m cache per core and the new one is 3.0 with 2m LSD`: turns out it is a compatibility problem after all. the manual specs just say 'pentium 4/Pentium D/Celeron/Celeron D' but at asus' website it lists all the procs compatible with the board, and only lists 800 series p-D's....the new one's a 930 that's weird. and it sucks",0

OK. That sounds sensible. b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: except since we are both using UTF-16, we probably want to sort by code unit instead of code point (matters for astral stuff) OK edit the wiki edited that is, I edited didn't mean to suggest that you edit it anyway... Ah, I was just about to do it :) I actually think the description of the format there isn't very close to what we have implemented b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: any major changes that I should be aware of? For example You don't need the #errors section to follow the #data section Basically the implementation we have assumes: #data starts a new test There is a known list of subsections of test data which all start #something eek. that's more complicated than absolutely necessary :-( b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: I can make changes if you want b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: I'd prefer the order of the subsections to be predictable. even better if all subsections were always there but a goal is to have the format slightly extensible so we can add extra (optional) sections to the tests like #innerHTML for the fragment case but most of all, I'd prefer the the sections to be considered to end with LF# instead of LF#foo Well I guess there's no problem saying ""Any line that starts '#' is a new subsection"" good It just means you can't have test data with that string in not much of a loss given that # isn't that interesting in test data at the start of a line Indeed Java API designers have a lot to learn from Python 4 lines to instantiate an XML parser another 4 to instantiate an XML serializer going with the default",0

"Microsoft Internet Explorer treats all unknown elements as empty. Only custom elements with namespace prefixes can contain other elements in the DOM. That's sort of true, except if you do document.createElement('foo') then it'll start parsing <foo> as non-empty i.e. <foo>a</foo><script>document.createElement('foo')</script><foo>b</foo> will produce an empty FOO element, then 'a', then an empty /FOO element, then a script element, then a foo element that contains 'b' That requires script support and does not work for restricted sites. Why would it be different in restricted sites? Because restricted sites do not allow scripts to run. Ah I know because I had to restrict several for my own use. Anyway, if the author wants arbitrary elements, he can use XML+CSS or XML+XSLT or a different browser There is no need to push them into HTML. The author surely can use a different browser. The problem is the viewer cannot. has to go away for a while The combination of restricted site and restricted browser sounds like intranet Restricting sites is useful at home as well. Nobody likes the browser to hang in the middle of something. There's no restriction on browsers at home, though. Internet Explorer has restricted zones. A site that belongs to a restricted zone is restricted. The decision on whether a site should be restricted is on the home user. If a user configures their browser so that some web sites stop working, that's the user's problem and it shouldn't be the authors' responsibility to cope with those atypical restrictions Is it just me, or is ""Re: [whatwg] SPOOFED: Re: SPOOFED: Re: ---"" a pretty rubbish subject line for an email thread? ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c, the original message with the subject ""[whatwg] ---"" was even more rubbish f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: I disagree - I think the longer subject exhibits more of what kids nowadays would call ""epic fail"" than the original I think placing sites into the restricted zone is a typical setting. It is better to have them restricted than to have them break the browser. hmm. Opera's ""always standards mode"" really means ""map quirks to standards but keep almost standards as almost standards"" the longer one is a result of poor spam filtering software and a lack of effort to manually clean it up, but the shorter one is a result of consiously using a bogus subject line The authorÃ­s responsibility is to publish valid content. Content that uses custom elements should remain invalid. ""SPOOFED"" means the presence of Envelope-Sender in this case. f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: So the shorter one is merely the result of consciously using a bogus subject line, whereas the longer one is a result of that plus poor spam filtering software plus another four authors who didn't bother fixing the subject and is therefore more rubbish It means WHATWG is posing as the author. That's because it's a pretty standard mailing list, so it's silly for a mail client to think that's a problem The world is a place of all sorts of weird things. That's what makes it interesting enough to bother living in :-)",0

I don't really know, probably that another CR will be needed if we miss the mark ; but if we miss the mark, we will loose all credibility in the consortium anyway we have 6 months to write a few tests and 3 implementation reports that should be doable, right ? I mean unless Opera/Apple/Mozilla don't want MQ to move to PR specs are not only the document it's also the test suite I'm pretty certain we'll hit a bunch of bugs and the question is whether implementations will have time to fix the bugs on time then we'll move back to WD if the spec is fine but the impl haven't had time to catch up yet? we cannot say that all the time ; at some point, you must say ok, we move forward then we don't have interoperability and can't mvoe out of CR but the CR has a ""deadline"" oh well yes I don't understand the reason for a meaningless deadline, but I don't really care e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0, you have to understand the W3C staff really questions ability of browser vendors in the CSS WG to make specs move forward because at some point, the commitment decreases sorry was disconnected I said : e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0, you have to understand the W3C staff really questions ability of browser vendors in the CSS WG to make specs move forward because at some point, the commitment decreases I don't think we can solve that with deadlines e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0, even browser vendors have deadlines and this WG has deadlines but there's no consequence for missing WG deadlines if we don't release CSS 2.1 before end of 2010, we'll smell the flavor of thunder fear has never really been a good motivator :) that's not a question of fear, it's a question of money this WG has not released a single REC in eleven yeaes years ""smell the flavor of thunder"" sounds like fear to me that does not change the fact it's not about changing facts, it's about solving the problem we _must_ release our specs as REC as soon as possible, and if browser vendors stop contributing to specs/test suite/implementations, this group is a dead duck if Opera cannot fix bugs in MQ, then MQ is a dead duck I'm assuming everyone will fix bugs, I'm just not sure everyone will fix bugs in a six month timeframe I'm pretty sure we won't",0

(might even be 0.2%, which i think i saw in another study i did, now that i think about it) (though i don't recall what that study was biased towards, so i'm not sure what that number was) either way application/xhtml+xml is far less common than, say, word documents at least in the google index of course it might be that the google index is biased against xhtml in some way though i'm not aware of such a bias Off the top of your head, do you know what Accept header GoogleBot outputs?

Thanks. content negotiation was such a mistake content negotiation and the content-type header both in fact where imho design mistakes of http we should have had a 1:1 mapping of resources to representations, and we should have used well-defined magic sequences to recognise types, so there could be no content sniffing or content-type mislabelling but oh well too late for that i guess s/where/were/ 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: How would the use of magic sequences interact with legacy file formats that don't have any unique distinguishing sequences? like what? plain text? plain text would be the default fallback format So every time a new format appears, you get binary soup in your face while each web server is updated? *web browser Or maybe either would do web servers wouldn't ever have to change to support new types under this model web browsers could detect binary data and treat them as we treat unknown binary data now (using a well-defined mechanism for detecting binary data -- it would be the fallback detection step before falling back to plain text) instead of hooking in to support mime types, I guess plugins would hook in for certain binary sequences? yup similar to what file(1) does on unix, but with a normative specification and a defined detection order",0

"f47636673b14c54021a69dc06f6a19fb: Try looking through for where the second column is an IP address most of them no ? Most of them no Enough in some datasets (though obviously not this one) for it to be a big enough issue for it to be ignored in most UAs PLus the fact that Content-Location = ""Content-Location"" "":"" ( absoluteURI | relativeURI ) Yeah. What you want to do is see if the IP address actually matches the URI if you try and access it huh? You mean line of this type http://209.184.141.5/caldwellheight/|http://209.184.141.5/caldwellheight/Default.htm ? Yeah what's wrong with those?

"quick question: I see how formnovalidate attrib works, but I don't see an example of how novalidate is used <form novalidate> ? sure, but if I put novalidate on the form, why bother putting an attribute like required on the input field? E.g. with forced previews you could put it on <form> though I suppose in most cases you might as well put it on the button not sure what a forced preview is - sorry! the example in the spec for formnovalidate makes absolute sense, but I can't see the use case for novalidate ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd, e.g. you have to roundtrip with the server at least once before you can actually submit a comment ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd, for that first roundtrip validation is not needed, but user feedback might still be useful I still don't see how this works in <form novalidate> sorry, I don't mean to sound like a pain/muppet trying to understand the difference :) one mo, let me mock up my understanding of formnovalidate, and perhaps you can tweak the source to show me how novalidate would work - if that's cool? sure example: http://jsbin.com/inaxo3 - editable source: http://jsbin.com/inaxo3/edit so I've got a formnovalidate on the ""save"" button edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: hit ""new revision"" to save any changes you make my form would have only one submit button see the form here: http://annevankesteren.nl/2010/03/css-wg-brainstorming#comments sure - but imagine the form is some big ebay style thing where there's lots of content being saved it's a contrived example I know :) it's more to show the formnovalidate attribute working but I'm struggling to see how novalidate comes in to play sure, i was just saying that for preview you might not care about validation yet and therefore add novalidate to <form> if you use it on the form element, then what's the point in having validation on the form at all? user feedback while entering controls you still have the form controls apply and all etc. it just doesn't prevent submission sites might want to use this too if they don't care if the user got the email address correct or not but still want the control to integrate with the address book and create better input methods okay, *that's* what I was looking for perfect, cheers. I can see it being used on the type=""email"" input, and as you said, still benefits from web forms integration cheers :) to be clear, ""novalidate"" cannot be specified on <input>, just on <form> crap. wonders if validate and formvalidate would have been better okay, so - say we didn't want to validate the email address field, and used type=""email"" to still integrate as you suggested no, it's either all or nothing but I want to validate the required field of their name crap. I just gave email as an example okay. for <input required> it's the same ideally you would people to fill in a name and give feedback to that effect, but if they don't it's no biggy and you put (anonymous + md5(ip)) there or something :) formnovalidate is really useful, I'm not sure novalidate is /that/ useful... :) it's mostly there for consistency all attributes on <form> for which it makes sense are exposed on submit buttons edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: managed to overcome the jetlag? not sure it makes much sense for enctype come to think of it 2466054b396284f05e6f6e4e7d3c806d, yeah, pretty much Good ^^ warming up for a new jetlag next week :)",0

"parsing rules written. next is... the processing model, i guess 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: Re:database names and paths, how about making them default to the active path (as a name prefix, or input parameter, or whatnot), but allow an override? That way they won't conflict by accident, and they can still be shared if needed so moving an application around on a host breaks it? i guess we could Moving an application is rarely a non-breaking operation anyhow really? There's always some URL that should've been absolute and was relative fair enough the problem i see though is that i think duplicate installs of the same software on a host are going to be at least as likely as moving installed software around on a host so you're just trading conflicts for breakages (and in both cases the software can be written/configured to work around it) True I guess I consider it better to support the case where several parties are involved, since it's much harder to coordinate but it's only gonna be an issue when you install the same software, and software can already just use location.path as part of their database name if they want Yes, but that requires every user to make that effort, rather than one user in the case of moving an app it requires one application software author to make the effort, instead of every user moving apps around s/apps/that app/ No, if the author does it, it will break users moving apps my point is i don't really see it as being much of a gain in either direction there are tradeoffs and i don't really see either as being better than the other (except that the status quo is simpler to spec and implement) That matters too, yeah",0

I get a 404 if I try that address in a web browser Looks like they only have 2.7.1 now it's annoying that the mirrors don't keep old versions I just discovered that the Inkscape docs do not completely describe Inkscape's SVG extensions I guess it's sensible to delete the old versions if the new version fixes security vulnerabilities, though I have no idea if that's relevant in this case I'm starting to wonder if trying to build specific support for Inkscrape extensions is a bad idea after all everything is harder than it first appears... haha. the unknown attribute that I find is documented to be INTERNAL USE ONLY; never serialized yeah, right I'm not sure who would find specific Inkscape support helpful - I would just want the validator to accept documents I exported from Inkscape and maybe modified by hand a little, and I wouldn't care about any details in the Inkscape-specific sections 3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2: I'm not checking the values of Inkscape attributes or anything, but I made a whitelist instead of allowing anything s/anything/everything/ in the last instance A whitelist allowing inkscape:* and sodipodi:* would allow the things I'd want it to allow (i.e. documents exported from past/current/future versions of Inkscape), and wouldn't miss any errors that I would make and would want to be warned about (because I'm not going to be writing/modifying things in Inkscape's namespaces) 3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2: would you allow those on XHTML elements and MathML, too? 3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2: would you allow <sodipodi:namedview/> outside <defs>? (the way I'm rationalizing this effort is that that inkscape cruft seems to be a pretty common issue) I guess I don't see why it would hurt to allow them, since interoperability is irrelevant for product-specific extensions like these... That sounds like a potentially dangerous view, though aside: IDness sucks. Chemical Markup Language is smart to avoid IDness. I think it's a bad idea, though, that CML's non-ID is called id so inkscape doesn't use globally unique IDs so when a single XHTML page includes two Inkscape drawings, their IDs will collide not cool but I guess I should report that as an error, given specs and all I can't think of a good reason to accept Inkscape-specific elements/attributes scattered through a document, but not accept e.g. MS Office's HTML-with-namespaces exporter's elements/attributes scattered through a document i think accepting either is potentially harmful but the latter sounds like something that shouldn't be accepted for documents published on the web, so I'm not sure why the former would be accepted e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0: I don't have an exactly good feeling about allowing the Inkscape cruft by default, but is it really useful to whine to authors about it? e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0: what's the harm? the SVG would do different things in inkscape versus other editors b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: Is there a standard way to combine documents with potentially-conflicting IDs? 3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2: not to my knowledge which might force other editors to support their stuff e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0: would it be bad if the Inkscape stuff became the de facto way of storing certain editing state in SVG? has had roughly that issue with X3D-plus-some-extensions, e.g. importing a file with some meshes and then referring to an ID in that file in order to animate it about as bad as <apple-canvas> becoming the de facto way of doing <canvas> on the Web e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0: I see your point e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0: still, it seems user-unfriendly to pretend that commonly-used extensions didn't exist (Currently I've got something like <Inline DEF=""a"" url=""some file with an element 'b'""/> and then you can use an almost-IDREF like ""a b"" to access the nested elements without conflicts) e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0: what's your take on http://intertwingly.net/blog/2007/11/16/Whitelisting#c1195315674 ? maybe you could make some widely used stuff a stron warning tries to fetch the page, should actually go and, yeah, if MS Office exported XHTML5 + namespaced extensions, I guess I should seriously consider supporting it on some level that keeps the validator useful for Office users I don't think vendor-extensions are that great (long term) and all other types of extensions really should be coordinated (although it should be easy to get them in the spec if people agree it's a good thing) as we see with SQL storage, etc. I have to go now e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0: (writing to log in case you read it when you come back): I agree that extensions should be coordinated and done without vendor namespaces ideally. However, Inkscape is using the extension mechanism that the SVG spec blesses b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: I get various messages like ""./syntax/non-schema/java/src/org/whattf/checker/TextContentChecker.java:27: package org.relaxng.datatype does not exist"" that look like missing dependencies (after modifying build.py to get xalan-j_2_7_1 instead of xalan-j_2_7_0) 3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2: that's weird. did onvdl compile successfully? that is, is there a file at jars/onvdl-whattf.jar ? There is a file there If I run 'build' again, the first reported error is ""./onvdl/src/nu/validator/relaxng/exceptions/UnfinishedElementException.jav./onvdl/src/com/thaiopensource/validate/SchemaReaderLoader.java:7: package org.apache.xalan.processor does not exist"" which probably makes sense because I manually downloaded xalan-j_2_7_1-bin.zip and it probably expects that file to be unpacked Looks a bit happier now (I don't know whether you can easily check that the dependency got unpacked properly) 3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2: the build script has a Python array of dependency jars. Does anyone want to suggest wording for a warning about product-specific extensions? b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: It seems ro run successfully now Also, can someone suggest a practical content model for foreignObject in the XHTML+SVG+MathML case? 3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2: nice s/ro/to/ org.xml.sax.SAXParseException: No implementation available for schema language with namespace URI âÃÃºhttp://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchemaâÃÃ¹ ...is what it says by default when trying to use XSD (before telling the user ""The document validates according to the specified schema(s)."") b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: HTML <html> or <div>, or MathML <math> (though HTML5 currently says only <html> would be allowed, i think) thinks <div> should be allowed as root notes that Atom uses <div> cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0: yeah, currently only <html> cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0: is needing a <div> there a cargo cult of do SVG impls break if foreignObject has more than one XHTML block element as children? b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: That thingy for enabling XSD seems to work correctly 3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2: nice. though its error messages are totally useless 3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2: then what's left is making sure that it uses the right EntityResolver 3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2: such as? Error: http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-schema-1#cvc-complex-type.3.2.2?X3D&width From line 1, column 1; to line 5, column 52 (is what it says for <X3D width>, given that width is not an allowed attribute) b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: haven't tested multiple children 3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2: weren't URI-identified errors supposed to be coolest thing around? :-) cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0: ok b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: i'd be fine with other elements as root as well (or multiple roots for that matter) b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: They tempt me to copy the URI into my address bar, and then taunt me by giving a 404 cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0: the SVG 1.1 spec uses <body>... b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: i see little reason to disallow it :) except that it makes the ""contexts in which this element is allowed"" more complex allowing any block or <html> as root seems like a simpler rule now needs to learn enough about XML Schema to move all the elements into a namespace and add some extensions 3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2: Jing/oNVDL doesn't interfere with those messages. There's only Xerces to blame wonders if there's a human-friendly error renderer in Xerces somewhere b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: I've used Xerces-C++, so I'm happy to blame it for many things :-) hmm. the W3C SVG 1.1 schema allows non-whitespace text node children in foreignObject. isn't that bogus? also, it allows <svg> there. isn't that bogus too as non-foreign? is it just me or is foreignObject seriously underdefined in SVG 1.1? what's the deal with SVG 1.2 Full not having a public WD since 13 April 2005? I thought SVG 1.1 Full was about to go to CR s/1.1/1.2/ b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: i thought they worked on 1.2 Tiny cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0: Tiny is a REC b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: oh? http://www.w3.org/TR/SVGMobile12/ says ""Candidate Recommendation"" for me cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0: oh right. I misread saw the capital R and forgot to read more to the left removes the code that disallows connections to localhost How are you meant to use IPv6 host addresses in HTTP URIs? http://::1/ is going to get confused with the port number syntax 3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2: wrap in [] http://[::1]/ or something like that b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: Ah, right b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: Does that mean http://validator.nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2F%5B%3A%3A1%5D%2F should be forbidden? 3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2: probably. 3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2: the localhost banning code is a broken tinfoil hat I tried to google for foreignObject demos but they are remarkably few in the top hits (Wow, IPv6 actually works on my local computer) 3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2: do you get routing to the outside world as well? b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: No $ ping6 ietf.org connect: Network is unreachable :-( if <foreignObject><div> is only a cargo cult, it is a strong one I don't like this. I wanted to see a proper spec for how foreignObject establishes a nested CSS rendering context (Hmm, it looks like the university network supports IPv6, but the CS department's network doesn't) (which seems a bit odd) (given that there are people here who do networky stuff) Jacques Distler has a use case for SVG in <annotation-xml>: http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/001475.html <xs:schema targetNamespace=""http://www.web3d.org/specifications/x3d-namespace"" xmlns=""http://www.web3d.org/specifications/x3d-namespace"" ...> That was unexpectedly straightforward",0

I doubt you can, unless you did something outside of JS/HTML like Java, or some custom server side stuff keep in mind, most users are behind NATs, so you get the NAT's MAC, not the exact user Hmm and by most, I pretty much mean all, probably mobile users are the only ones not behind a NAT home users are NAT'd, especially wireless biz users all are so you can have multiple ppl with the same MAC... and that's assuming you can capture it iow, it's pretty useless, why? User identification for a localization system I am working on... I don't see how MAC has anything to do with location are you just looking for an absolute way to be sure somebody is the same user, like perhaps later on? Yes dude,. just use EverCookie lol, when you have a problem, ask the core question not about some specific hack you're pondering I can't really go into specifics, sorry :| if it's web based, EverCookie does exactly what you want Thing is I _need_ the Bluetooth MAC address from a mobile device for this project Do you mind sending you a PM? mind me sending you* I can't help you with what you're trying, this is as far as I can go Well, thanks for your helpâÃÂ¶ now for more research you really need a native app, not a web page and even then, you might not have access to that internal info, especially on iOS",0

Bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=673689 nor, --, ---, jigneshhk1992, NEW, introduce namespace role tbsaunde: yeah 54c75a6f529f74199de9bd0e16991a7d: so, first in atk/nsMaiInterfaceTable.cpp there's two calls to nsAccUtils::ROle() you should keep comparing against xpcom roles there 54c75a6f529f74199de9bd0e16991a7d: then in atk/nsMaiInterfaceText.cpp there is Role atkRole = atkRoleMap[accessible->NativeRole()] that should stay PRUint32 the purpose of that array is to convert elements of the enum role to the atk roles, so there's no reason to believe an element of the array is an element of the roles enum 54c75a6f529f74199de9bd0e16991a7d: next, atkRoleMap is defined as static const PRUint32 it shouldn't be static, and the type should be AtkRole (you didn't change it, just something to clean up along the way) which file? next thing, in base/AccGroupInfo.cpp you didn't fixthe order of includes atk/nsRoleMap.h okay 54c75a6f529f74199de9bd0e16991a7d: again in AccGroupInfo.cpp near line 132 the if should fit on one line All done upto last comment. 54c75a6f529f74199de9bd0e16991a7d: ok, then in AccGrouPInfo::IsConceptualParent() it looks like some of those ifs could take a line less ya I was thinking same thing 54c75a6f529f74199de9bd0e16991a7d: maybe AccGroupInfo::BaseRole() too 54c75a6f529f74199de9bd0e16991a7d: in base/NotificationController.cpp you didn't fix include ordering 54c75a6f529f74199de9bd0e16991a7d: then in ROles.h leave a blank line after the brace for the end of role namespace 54c75a6f529f74199de9bd0e16991a7d: then in nsARIAGridAccessible.cpp in SetARIASelected() the if with three role checks and the one testing nsAccUtils::IsARIASelected() then again nsARIAGridCellAccessible::GetTable() and GetColumnIndex() nsARIAGridCellAccessible::GetAttributesInternal() second if and the third done ok, thanks, a lot of this just looks good :) tbsaunde : Uploading latest patch in min. 54c75a6f529f74199de9bd0e16991a7d: I still have more comments for the rest of this one so hold on :) ok 54c75a6f529f74199de9bd0e16991a7d: in nsAccessibilityService.cpp 1087 the if should fit on one line 54c75a6f529f74199de9bd0e16991a7d: did you find the other bugs I talked about yesterday? again line 1138 Is that about Bug 539683 Bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=539683 nor, --, ---, nobody, NEW, defunct object methods should return CO_E_OBJECTNOTCONNECTED 54c75a6f529f74199de9bd0e16991a7d: it would be great if you fixed that one yup not sure if I can do that. but will try. 54c75a6f529f74199de9bd0e16991a7d: ok :) I'll help if you have questions 54c75a6f529f74199de9bd0e16991a7d: nsAccessible::GetRole() should take a PRUint32* not a Role* because its xpcom method also don't change what *aRole is initially set to in that method 54c75a6f529f74199de9bd0e16991a7d: just before you dropped out 54c75a6f529f74199de9bd0e16991a7d: nsAccessible::GetRole() should take a PRUint32* not a Role* because its xpcom method and shouldn't use role::foo ya I got that. in nsaccessiblityservice.cpp there are 2 if of which we can't get rid of . crossing 80 limits line 1138 54c75a6f529f74199de9bd0e16991a7d: ok, I though we might be able to but ok thx 54c75a6f529f74199de9bd0e16991a7d: nsAccessible::NativeRole() fits on one line right? ya 54c75a6f529f74199de9bd0e16991a7d: for bug 539683 if you don't have a windows machine to build on I can look for other bugs, we have a bunch Bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=539683 nor, --, ---, nobody, NEW, defunct object methods should return CO_E_OBJECTNOTCONNECTED others will be good. not using windows. 54c75a6f529f74199de9bd0e16991a7d: ok, me too tbsaunde : review done? 54c75a6f529f74199de9bd0e16991a7d: no, went off to find you bugs :) 54c75a6f529f74199de9bd0e16991a7d: how about bug 539694?

I was thinking having linux be a samba client that maps to few windows/linux shares then having that same machine becmoe a centeralize server via samba that anyone could map to afaik cifs is not aware of that what y want cifs cant use a DFS share atm do you know of another way that this can be done? no smbfs is not maintained and there is no other smb aware client for linux atm so there isn't a method of dfs in linux only MS then ? I know server2003 allows for a heir. of tree shares but I was trying to see if opensource has anything similiar yup there is no way currently try to convince stevenf at samba org heh thanks for your time anyways",0

"ok need advice I work for a company with clients still say want their site to support ie6 I've been working ie6 in 2010 and before and this new year i refuse to support the browser but here's the catch, it's my job what should i do? as in i'm fine with building sites ie7 and up, ff, chrome etc you could either not fight and keep supporting, or create a valid concise arguement as to why IE6 is seriously irrelevant anymore what if they say, we don't agree insert arguements like development time needed to fix all the issues, increased resources etc can I say, fine then get someone to fix those ie6 issues\ cuz im not if you want to risk it it's effin' stupid though.. damn why do i need to explain to not build sites for a browser that's 10 years old? it becomes an argument with fools because it has a long history of still being around and the person fixing is me at the end of day.. and i'm done with it i'm sick of it loll like i said, present a solid arguement against it, and present er, take off that end part :D i repeated myself hmm.. i'll see fuckin ie9 is out now the first bit was getting people off of IE6, now it's turning into a case of getting people off of XP so that they can get upgraded to IE9 that's going to be the harder part, imho blah i just want to say ""Guys I don't fix for ie6 anymore, cheers"" lol they should be happy i'm still doing ie7 anyway, i'll see what to do all a matter of convincing the client don't forget to monitor visitor traffic see how many people are actually using it i could care less about that, in the U.S. it's less than 2% that's what matters i don't live in China personally, i wouldn't feel bad about offending 50 people with a bad lookin website it's stupid obvious China is the only country that can argue lol honestly, with my personal traffic, that'd be a lot of people, but if they get 1000s daily or so, 50 isn't much i'm just not afraid to offend a small handful of people the people going to your site or the client which one? my site and actually i have no contact with client well, sites i work for a company that has clients ohok if i could, i'd offend the ""potential customers"" too gotcha you could get flat out arrogant ""if you're using that browser, i don't want your business"" at least for the personal level I'm about to put log output stream on a html5 page. How do I do that best? And to make sure the most lower item is always shown?",0

"Hello everyone, I am working on a layout for my site, it seems upon drag resizing the window to a very short width, the layout mucks up a bunch on the right, just curious if someone can help me fix this. Here is the link: www.pyru.info/project2/register.php Thanks! Hello everyone, I am working on a layout for my site, it seems upon drag resizing the window to a very short width, the layout mucks up a bunch on the right, just curious if someone can help me fix this. Here is the link: www.pyru.info/project2/register.php Thanks! don't repeat Pyru: how short of a width? 100px? ummm the right boxes? Pyru: how short of a width for the quirk to happen? but nevermind, I just saw it =P :( Pyru: the table cell holding the Divs is correctly sizing down with the window, and the boxes keeping their auto dimensions properly and bleeding out as they would hmm Pyru: so, is all good as far as I can tell, the boxes do come out when the parent box, the TD, changes its percentage driven width with the containing window all you can do is prevent the TD from resizing by using a table-layout: fixed; on its parent Table well not quite well yes quite heheehe lol I don't want it resizing like that because then the text moves into more lines etc using 100% makes the Table width dependent on the parent container's so, if you don't want the TD shrinking to a point the child Divs will bleed out, then you do have to provided a fixed minimum =/ to a px width? table-layout: fixed; works on the Table and then on the 1st TR of, the the 2nd TD give it a fixed figure the % unit is what makes the TD shrink Pyru: the Divs do not have a width set, but since they're all in a TD, the longest-word Div will dictate the Div's width, and while the TD shrinks, the Div can't due to lack of white-space to wrap chars :) in this case is just noticeable, as if it was only text, because is text children of Divs with borders, otherwise you'd just see the longestwords stick out alright im still confused lol though I see your trying explain it to me I'm just new to html / css really :P hehe word wrapping, occurrs where there's spaces, if the word is as long as iknowwhatyoudidlastnite then the word is kept and no wrapping occurs, if the parent box width changes to smaller than those chars will need, than the chars are bled out :) yes which is happening with my layout :( CSS3 fixes that short coming with CSS2, adding properties for breaking words and adding hyphens",0

"Hi i have a lil question about the configuration file is anyone here ? :D Well i'll ask :D Do you save config using java serialisation? if yes that would mean each time you add stuff to the config class (new options for exemple) the old config file can't be used anymore, so the user loose his config but i think u use something else, cuz i never lost my config except when u change between 2 version (can't remember wich ones) **except once between 2 versions** <NazO> Do you save config using java serialisation? <- it's bencoded ... and btw, you wouldn't use serialisation either, a property map would be much better so azureus save it's config files using a property map.... so we have a Map that's saved in a file ... <NazO> so azureus save it's config files using a property map.... <- no k :d i said it's bencoded how does it work in 2-3 words ^^ cuz if version 2 have for exemple 4 boolean to save and version 3 have 6 boolean to save when upgrading to version 3 and loading the config file for the first time well, do you need help with a java implementation or do you want to know what azureus is doing? u see there's only 4 boolean in it if you're writing your own app just use a PropertyMap k so i can add stuff between version without any problem? yes nice :D <a href=""http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html"">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html</a> and about azureus just by curiosity they bencode it yes but they have to manage it between changes? or its no prob that's a matter of programming/using default values for non-existant values okay thx that's what i have to do for my language stuff in my app ^^ errr cuz for now i have to enter all the keys in each files that sux ^^ thank you very much NazO, you want to use this one: <a href=""http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/ResourceBundle.html"">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/ResourceBundle.html</a> nice thx :D i'll look at it now :D aah so each language file has its own class in my soft i was using 1 class that load the correct language file well no forget what i just said, i'll go fully read it first :d",0
"I have this line ""-A INPUT -s 81.0.0.0/8 -j DROP"" in my firewall, as a matter of testing, I'm trying to understand why this prevents whois on the localmachine from contacting whois.denic.de which has IP 81.91.162.8 ... I am making an outbound request.. ooh.. n/m.. it cannot answer back.. sheesh.. time to eat killermach: probably because you are not using stateful filtering... callee: that rule was meant to drop ALL incoming packets from the 81.0.0.0 network, how could stateful filtering differ meaning: you send a whois request out, and get an answer. however iptables is unable to see that the incoming request is a reply to the previous outgoing request. thats why you need the state module callee: I see.. that could be useful see, you do not only want to request the whois query, but you surely want an anser... answer yes yes.. I'm also new to iptables. I have to learn more look at the tutorial in the topic callee: can you get someone to remove the "" ; "" from the URL.. it gives a page not found, I already removed it in Firefox, so I'm there now killermach: i do not see a "";"" in the url ah, there it is mostly I'm trying to remove network access from what seems to be mostly spam emailers, I hate to do such blanket rules, but until I find a way to fine tune iptables without spending all day everyday doing it, this is it well, technically there is no "";"" in the url, just behind it killermach: try the hash module however dunno how that exactly works but there is no O(1) way to get rid of the spammers with iptables if you run a mailserver it's best to stick with blacklists on the maildaemon side or greylists or whatever you prefer, but don't try to use iptables for that. remember iptables does only packet filtering and is often the first but not only line of defence, so it is unnecessary to make the mesh too tight at the beginning, for you screw more up then you fix if you wanna drop traffic from i.e. rpc worms or so just drop all traffic to the ports on the WAN interface you are not serving explicitly. this only applies to incoming traffic of course. iptables is not useful for restricting outgoing packets thats not what iptables is written for. you can do outgoing filtering, but it is not recommended (at least for the most part)",0

"finds it really strange to be reading papers from research conferences that include fragments of XML and RDF and talk about OWL and stuff I suppose it's good that people are using the technologies, but it seems very far removed from the web ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: is http://www.rijksmuseum.nl/ far removed from the web? I listened in on a presentation about this during last year's xtech, and it's almost all built on semweb stuff 0da07476c4bd14079ce4032a6f280e17: No, but that's independent of the issue of me hearing about RDF/OWL/etc in contexts that have very little to do with the web (e.g. policy services frameworks for distributed computing platforms in industrial, military and space applications, in one particular example) ah I guess it's a decent enough means of data exchange for those industries There's a strange mixture of lines like (M, ÅÃ) âÃ¤Â® p âÃ¡Ã® p âÃ Ã¤ L(ÅÃâÃÃ) and lines like <Resource name=""XI_J2EE_LOP_achalm47_AS"" class=""IBM.Application"" node=""achalm47""> in one paper (and I can understand the former much better than the latter) 0da07476c4bd14079ce4032a6f280e17: but does rijksmuseum expose its RDF data to the public?

I ask, because I did enable all sorts of debugging options on my previous distro, though I think I remember those options going into the 'azureus' wrapper script, not my ~/.azureus directory (and that wrapper script is long since gone) Samus_Aran: at least that option is not there on this linux azureus I no longer see the azureus jar file in /usr/share/java, hm. perhaps my distro did update it when I did a global update hrr, distro version... :) okay, figured out what's going on.

"anyone able to give me a hand getting jk working? i have tomcat standalone working, but can't get it to work with mod_jk grim: I have this: <a href=""http://wiki.wsmoak.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?TomcatConnectors"">http://wiki.wsmoak.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?TomcatConnectors</a> it's actually about adding a second Tomcat to an existing setup though. wsmoak: well i have no problem with removing the standalone.. the thing is, it ""appears"" to be somewhat working, but i honestly have no idea what i'm doing here.. The usual question is why do you want to add Apache httpd? :) wsmoak: heres the url of a directory that has a servlet it in, <a href=""http://guifications.org/apps/"">http://guifications.org/apps/</a> because i'm trying not to expose anything extra on the net than need be, and because i'm just going to be using this for one servlet, so to me, it was just sensical to have it available in the main website url path Ok, so you already have httpd doing other things. Just checking. :) yes i have the workers.properties, it appears to be working since /apps displays tomcat info, and so on, i just can not for the life of me figure out why /apps is unavailable.. so we're getting through to Tomcat... (the 404 comes from Tomcat) yeah now /apps is in the apache docroot, is that a possible cause? Does it work w/o Apache, on :8080 ? yes, under debian, tomcat listens on port 8180 ... and you can get to /apps and it does what it's supposed to? oh, haven't tried that... i'm trying to use a vhost in apache.. i'm hosting a few domains, and numerous subdomains here and i really only need tomcat on one.. so no sense in enabling it across them all i have the jkmount's in the vhost directive If it doesn't work in Tomcat alone, it isn't going to work with Apache in front. Make sure you can view <a href=""http://whatever.com"">http://whatever.com</a>:8180/apps, even if you have to do it from localhost. Oh come'n, have more faith in Apache, would you? :) ok, so the servlets have to be in tomcat_home then huh? none of the tutorials i followed succeeded in mentioning that ? You can put your Tomcat webapp wherever, assuming you configure Tomcat correctly. grim, <a href=""http://howto.bloo.ms/Tomcat5.5.Apache2.VirtualHost.jk_mod.Subversion.Eclipse.Subclipse/"">http://howto.bloo.ms/Tomcat5.5.Apache2.VirtualHost.jk_mod.Subversion.Eclipse.Subclipse/</a> wsmoak: ok, well then thats the piece i seem to be missing.. So... we're not sure that the webapp is actually running? Uviz: my apache conf is nearly identical wsmoak: correct Lets get that working first. You have a .war file, or ? i have a war, but the site i got it from said to extract it ok, but it looks like i just add a host in the appserver engine huh.. where did you put the .war file (or extracted version thereof) ? inside of my $(APACHE_DOCROOT)/apps Where is $TOMCAT_HOME? Look for $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps . i have both /var/lib/tomcat5 and /usr/share/tomcat5 /var/lib/tomcat5 has webapps put the webapp there, so that you have tomcat5/webapps/appname done This is the default location for webapps. Once it works here, you can move it if you want. Now start (or re-start) Tomcat. what url do i use to access this? done <a href=""http://localhost"">http://localhost</a>:8180/<directory-name-under-webapps> caught an exception.. <a href=""http://guifications.org"">http://guifications.org</a>:8180/jamm/login.jsp?done=/private/index.jsp will be a moment, firewall needs adjusting...

Oh. It's a Struts app. :) Looks like tiles isn't configures right. theres 2 things to do, copy jamm.properties.dist to jamm.properties, and then change the base for ldap, which i haven't done yet because it _should_ work normally without that fix Well... it's unhappy about something. Anyway, now that the app is (sort of) starting, you should be able to adjust the JK config to point at it. arlight, i think.. well how do i fix this struts issue? ... ask the person who wrote the webapp ? well the issue is that struts wasn't installed, i installed it, restarted tomcat, it's still not finding it.. what do you mean you installed struts? $ sudo apt-get install libstruts1.2-java unless that wasn't what i thought it was.. Unlikely that Tomcat can ""see"" those. Look in .../webapps/jamm/WEB-INF/lib -- struts should already be there. (Otherwise you wouldn't be getting exceptions from org.apache.struts.* classes.) yep, struts-legacy.jar and struts.jar Does this app have a support forum? Maybe it's a know issue. known. Honestly, I really can type. i'm searching their mailing list now What is jamm? (this time..)

"Hixie, could you say that if a URL resolves to the current resource, and the user agent knows that a text/html response will cause an error, it can decline to fetch the resource even if it's not actually in cache, on the assumption that it will be text/html? (Similar for XML MIME types.) As for validation, surely something somewhere already says that script/stylesheet/etc. links must point to documents of the correct type. E.g., if <script src=""""></script> points to a text/html file, then that violates the sentence ""If the language is not that described by ""text/javascript"", then the type attribute must be present, as described below."" So a validator could recognize that """" is not a text/javascript resource and raise an error. 88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762: Some people (like hsivonen, I think) don't like the validity of a document depending on external resources It makes it really hard to check that a document is valid and that it stays valid You can't check all validity requirements anyway. (and you'd get different results when copying-and-pasting into a text input box vs pointing at the URL) Hmm, true. That's not a reason to add more requirements that can't be checked particularly since it's a lot of complexity for something that nobody is going to do on purpose The requirement already exists, I'm not suggesting it be added. :) s/particularly since/Also,/ Oh, okay Validators that don't want to depend on whether you copy-paste or point at the URL can implement only special cases of this check -- like saying it's an error only if the URL resolves to the current document, but HTML is the wrong type for the link. Which is the current case. Actually, <script src=""""> doesn't point to a text/html file because (per the spec) it doesn't resolve to anything It doesn't? It hasn't done for at least 16 hours So I think that's not a problematic case, because it points at nothing and is clearly an error The problematic case was like <link rel=""stylesheet index"" href=""""> where the stylesheet link doesn't point to anything, while the index link points to the base URL Well, I was making suggestions to Hixie based on the previous version of the spec. As an alternative fix. The previous version of the spec would download the current page again if you wrote <script src=""""> which was the problem so the fix would have to involve changing it to not download the current page again and so it couldn't then define validity in terms of the downloaded resource although I think I forgot to read what you actually said Right. My suggestion was that the spec say that if a URL is known to resolve to the current resource, then if that URL is used for something that's not supposed to be HTML, the UA can raise an error without bothering to actually retrieve the resource. Or just ignore it, or something. And validators can say it's an error if they know it resolves to the current resource. I guess that's messier than just adding some special cases, but it seems less hackish. That seems like a lot of complexity for something that nobody is going to do on purpose It doesn't seem non-hackish to me, because it's still going to do weird things in hypothetical cases like a POST response page saying <script src=""""> where the GET returns a different content-type and it'll be hard for authors to predict behaviour because it'll depend on whether the UA cached enough information about the page I guess.",0

GlaDiaC: curl is installed by default, yes ffmpeg is not hjst: could it be easily installed? sure you could compile it yourself, or use macports or fink (both package managers) ah great hjst: speex? not by default, but it's in macports 1.0.5 you can search the fink package repo here: <a href=""http://pdb.finkproject.org/pdb/index.php?phpLang=en"">http://pdb.finkproject.org/pdb/index.php?phpLang=en</a> <a href=""http://darwinports.opendarwin.org/ports/"">http://darwinports.opendarwin.org/ports/</a> ^ search macports this helps a lot default path is /usr ? no macports puts stuff in /opt I think fink puts stuff in /sw obviously anything you do yourself will be in /usr/local hmm ok is there pkg-config availiable on mac? hjst: I'm migrating WengoPhone to cmake (new build system) and I need to know where the paths are on macosx, cause I don't own one GlaDiaC: I see - I don't know about pkg-config hjst: ok it's just C though right? it'll probably compile so e.g. openssl is ""pkg-config works on multiple platforms: Linux and other UNIX-like operating systems, Mac OS X and Windows."" /opt/lib/libssl.so or /sw/lib/libssl.so /usr/lib/libssl.so well, on my system with macports, a 'locate libssl' shows these: /opt/local/lib/libssl.0.9.8.dylib /opt/local/lib/libssl.dylib /usr/lib/libssl.0.9.7.dylib /usr/lib/libssl.dylib ah ok could it be /opt/lib too? gah! i HATE that safari doesn't ask you to confirm the quit command when W is right next to Q on the keyboard GlaDiaC: there is no /opt/lib on my machine only /opt/local/lib if you want to ask more specific questions, you could try #macports - they should be able to tell you more about lib paths etc. is a fink user arround? whats up Tenkawa: what is the libdir which uses fink /sw/lib ? yep this is the only one? or is ther /sw/local/lib too? only /sw/lib on my box Tenkawa: thanks no problem :) i hope i have all directories now heheh heh I hope I don't screw up the freebsd kernel I'm working on haaahaaa grrr just bought civ4 and it needs to have the cd in the drive to play rubbish copying/mounting the disk image with disk util doesn't work like it did with civ3 either is there some other means of imaging a dvd?",0

Deny from env=evil hmm, that doesn't work SetEnvIf Request_URI ""&amp;"" evil=1 ? nope the documentation is crap oh yeah, looks like that's redundant.

Back then it was: RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} DECLARE RewriteRule ^(.*) - [F] ""See the RewriteCond directive of mod_rewrite for extra information on how to match your query string."" sigh so s/DECLARE/&amp;/ and put a RewriteEngine On above it. nice there is this bot hitting web-apps-tracker for a couple of months now and eating 15 gigabytes a month or so youch it apparently fetches &amp; URIs seems to work I wish there was a nicer way to write RewriteRule when you don't actually care about the URIs serving lots of 403 I suppose ""RewriteRule . - [F]"" is the most concise thing you can do The bot doesn't come from a single ip?

I'm thinking of suggesting they be folded into one no, but please don't change that because that would break all my queries all my queries, bookmarks, scripts, etc, use those two components I see (similarly, please don't add new components) is it possible to make, say, the ""proposals"" one closed to new bugs without removing it fully? dunno is it causing a problem? not really, just minor annoyance when forming a query by hand ah I do think separate drafts should have separate components, cause otherwise it's pretty hard to separately track when each gets to 0 bugs in a non-terminal state well if there are other editors, they should get components, sure, but for drafts i edit i treat them all as one draft anyway so it's moot so I'm seeing 231 bugs resolved since the start of the month 67 still open incoming rate must be out of control since there were fewer than 200 open on the 1st incoming rate grew significantly higher than i expected, yes though i don't track that so i don't have numbers 115 created since the start of the month Jeez, that's 10 a day. FWIW 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e's accept/reject rate is still around 50% of the non-garbage bugs (where by ""garbage"" I mean duplicate or invalid) I looked at some past months and the rate seems to be slowly going down over time the highest I found was 70% as in i'm rejecting more? that seems like pretty much whatI would expect for a maturing spec yes, you seem to be rejecting more percentage-wise than in, say, July i'd expect the rate to go the other way, actually, because the problems should be getting more trivial (e.g. reviewers should be moving from ""this doesn't work"" to ""this is misspelt"") well some reviewers are still submitting requests for new features there might be a better correlation of rate vs reporter than rate vs time but you're right, I could imagine it going the other way if the proportion of editorial issues was increasing as one might expect possible - I did not try to measure that cause it would be too much work :-)",0

They draw the arc from (start mod 2pi) anticlockwise to (end mod 2pi) seems dumb to do something different for 0..2pi+e than for -(2pi+e)..0 well, i guess not hmm Firefox and Safari will need to be changed to match the spec anyway, because they handle arc(x,y,r, 0, 4*Math.PI, false) by drawing a 4pi arc (which is kind of crazy) instead of a 2pi arc, so I suppose it doesn't hurt if the spec requires some extra changes too i'm changing it to not do a whole circle for those cases They don't do something different for 0..2pi+e than for -(2pi+e)..0 since that's just uniformly rotating the whole arc by -(2pi+e) The issue is that for 0..3pi clockwise they draw a circle, and for 0..3pi anticlockwise they draw a semicircle The issue is that for 0..3pi clockwise they draw a circle, and for 3pi..0 clockwise they draw a semicircle, and that makes sense to me for some reason, and i want the spec to require that no? That doesn't make more or less sense to me than any other thing the spec could require - it just has the advantage of matching most deployed implementations yeah i agree that it doesn't make any more objective sense though for some reason it does have some weird feeling of rightness to me anyway the spec says that now The most sensible solution would be ""if clockwise and end < start, or if anticlockwise and end > start, throw an exception because you're being silly and trying to draw the arc in the wrong direction"" Actually you could just skip the clockwise/anticlockwise flag entirely, and have it depend solely on the relative angles But that doesn't work so well for compatibility with existing code/implementations notices that he has trouble thinking coherently, and goes to bed n",0

"Hey Would you mind listening to a horny guys sorrows? umm..i suppose so Sorry to bother you with this But .... Do you have ANY fucking clue how hard it is to get sexxed up when you are basically a thinking plant? Seriously The dumb plants have it lucky And my luck is SO perfect I just HAPPEN to mutate and gain the ability to take a host And what happens? haha..what the hell? I get stuck with a fucking human because I exist on planet fucking earth No offence to humans Crazy huh? haha..none taken I mean having a human host isnt ALL bad I get to THINK for starters But the whole needing sex thing tends to be a major drawback when you look like a plant Well I mean Im still growing So its obvious im not a normal human And sadly no normal human would want me SO im stuck here suffering Like I said My million brothers and sisters have it so lucky They dont need thought haha..is this going on chatroulettetrolls.com? Or You know Sex WHats that Is that a virus site no..its funny chats from here and chat roulette.. Oh cool Sounds interesting Hey do you know any good porn Right now I think i need it of the palnt or human variety? Ehhh long as it has tentacles I dont care wow...can't help you with that one..=) Aww Not even that drawn stuff? *Sigh* Do you have ANYTHING? Hell at this point I would settle for plain human porn. haha..i dont know.. have you tried googling it? Google sucks What should I search for that is entirely up to you... But I dont know what to look for plant pollenation..images.. have fun Ok ill try hang on OH SHIT Thanks man Oh wow that is so hot haha..im sorry but this has got to be the wierdest conversation i've had on here.. You are so awesome Is there any way I can pay you back for this? yeah... when you finally evolve into what ever the hell you plan on becoming...dont kill me Naah man thats not my plan. Never was. This isnt some crazy film with plants that take over the planet Im a normal plant and or human other then my ability to take a hot Host* And heck I cant even undo the bonding process till my current host body dies btw..who is your host? I mean sure maybe in a few hundred thousand years the built up memories and thoughts will cause my mass to grow to the point where I can take two hosts at once but thats waaay off I dunno im still not too good at accessing his memories this is all very complicated.. Seriously though is there ANYTHING I can do to pay you back? Yeah it is isnt it umm..i will have to think about it..what all can you do? Im not sure yet Ive only had thought for a couple years now I mean my host had to have been at least 30 years old but hmm..any cool tricks? Well not much that ive figure out yet other then being able to sprout tentacles if I consume enough mass Sadly I have not figure out how to keep them from drying out Which is bad that sounds kind of groos..how do you type? *gross Remember the whole host body thing? I didnt EAT him And I can use his hands But yeah the tentacle thing isnt gross till they dry out Yuck oh..i figured he was kind of done for.. Still till they dry out they are kind o f good for self pleasuring Well he is done for But his body is fine Its like.. Zombies. The person dies but the body and sometimes the memories remain The difference is that zombies rot And are mindless Ish Seriously though im sure you think the whole tentacle self pleasuring thing is gross. You being a human and all. Am I right? umm..a little odd, yeah..but i try not to judge..its called cultural relativism Very smart of you Just more proof that being stuck on earth isnt so bad huh? no its not bad..and hey..if you turn out not looking weird you might not get stared at very much=) Yeah but I dont plan to reveal myself at LEAST till you humans master space travel cause by then having a plantlike creature suddenly appear wouldnt be too odd would it hey we've been to the moon...more than once i think.. Yeah but I mean when space travel is like current times plane travel I mean if I showed up now i would probably be just taken in for experiments or something oh..i think richard branson is working on that, actually.. Once you hit space stuff like me would probably be unusual in the sense that theres ONLY one of me I mean just think of all the crazy stuff that could be lurking in your own star system! yeah..i just watched planet 51 so i know all about inter planetary relations... Hmm never seen that one Whats it about its actually pretty good..i think its a disney movie..an earth astronaut lands on another planet and hes considered the alien.. Cool What happens in it? he teams up with this kid to get his ship back, but he gets captured and taken to that planets area 51 ..but he gets saved by the kid Seems cool Ill have to look at it if I get a chance im a great movie summarizer=\ Hahah But yeah ill have to see how well they did with it Dont those disney people make childrens movies? yeah..its a kids movie...i watched it casue my favorite band was in the preveiw..i am not ashamed=) Meh Is it one of those ""Kids"" movies where every male character has a giant bulging crotch? haha..i didnt notice.. Heh Anyways thanks again for the great porn Bye now that you mention it im remembering all the princes in the disney movies..thanks for that.. Heheh Im just sorry I couldnt pay you back any better way then a thanks thats alright..its good for my karma.. Your karma must love you then i hope so..im due for my payback..=) I hope you get it well i'll let you get to growing..or evolving or whatevr you need to do..=) bye Bye",0

"69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: I'm writing <select required> checking for the validator and I the spec seems quite clear but I want to doublecheck so, question: the following should be valid, right? <select required> <option></option> </select> and the following should not be? <select required> <option value=1>foo</option> </select> i assume we're ignoring the <option> here, right? attribute-wise? or should i check the option requirements too there are not requirements on the option in that case, as far as I can see so, no, anyway, you don't need to check the option requirements for that first case I just meant is is valid as far as the select goes in the first case, the option has to have a value="""" if its contents aren't """". the second one is invalid, indeed so yes, valid and not valid the first might want to emit a warning that the author probably forgot to give the text of the placeholder label option dunno how much linting you're doing OK hmm but now I do think I'm misunderstanding something which ish, how do you give the text of the placeholder label option looks back at the spec in the label="""" or textContent of the <option> ok but the spec says, ""if the value of the first option element in the select element's list of options (if any) is the empty string, and that option element's parent node is the select element (and not an optgroup element), then that option is the select element's placeholder label option."" should that be ""is *not* the empty string""? sorry afk brb ok 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: (when you get back), so it seems like maybe it should say that the value attribute is empty (or not specified), but the option must have textContent because, unless I'm missing something, I don't see how the option element can serve as an actual placeholder label option if the ""value of the option element"" (= ""the value of the value attribute, if there is one, or the textContent of the element, if there isn't"") has to be the empty string in other words, the current spec text seems to require the following to be reported as invalid <select required> <option>Choose one of the following</option> <option value=1>foo</option> <option value=2>bar</option> </select> because it must have a placeholder label option, but the value of the first option element is not the empty string, so it does not have a placeholder label option a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: back hey a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: right, if you have required in that case you also have to have <option value="""">label</option> required="""", i mean ok because otherwise there's no point having required="""" -- it'd be required anyway you can't _not_ give a value in that case so marking it required="""" is worthless right, but that's not what the spec seems to say oh? looks in that case, it doesn't have a placeholder label option, and it must have a placeholder label option, right? it doesn't have one because the value of the first option is ""1"", so the first option is not a placeholder label option oh but the first option has no value attributeâÃÂ¶ the value of the second option is 1 oh sorry i mean the value of the first option is ""Choose one of the following"" yeah OK I think I see what the purpose of this is now you probably want the validator to notice when the first one have a value=""non-empty"" and give a distinct error than the case where it is simply missing a value="""" (but has textContent, as opposed to <option label=""choose one of the following"">, which would be fine) because the error message would be confusing otherwise OK so sorry if I'm being daft here, but if the following is not OK, what should it be changed to? <select required> <option></option> <option value=1>foo</option> <option value=2>bar</option> </select> it's fine, from a validation point of view OK, but what I'm getting at is, the spec currently says that for an option to be a placeholder label option, its ""value"" must be the empty string where ""value"" is defined as ""the value of the value attribute, if there is one, or the textContent of the element, if there isn't"" right (hm, we should probably strip spaces before and after the textContent, for sanity, so that omitting the </option> in the case above doesn't matter, but that's another story) (i'll file a bug) so that would seem to mean that <option value="""">label</option> cannot be a placeholder label option sure it can value="""" is good OK but the ""value"" of the option is non-empty because it has textContent the value is the value of the value attribute, if there is one ah yeah thanks for your patience :) no worries this stuff is inane, and i make enough mistakes that half the time your questions are just pointing out mistakes i made :-) heh not sure that's true, but thanks for saying it :) I wish there was a way to do X-viewport: content=""width=device-width"" in HTTP headers 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: so why not have the spec say that for <select required>, its first option child must have a value="""" attribute specified? a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: we could do that, but in the case of <option label=""..""/> it's a bit ugly to require an otherwise redundant value="""" as well OK I will implement it as currently specced so that we have something concrete to test with in the validator cool i just filed a bug about the definition of /option label/ that you might want to look at but I should point out to you that as far as I can see, the spec currently doesn't say anything about the label attribute providing the text for the placeholder label option OK, I'll look at that bug looks it doesn't say anything special about the placeholder label option vs other options as far as rendering goes",0

"really? huh i would have thought you could run a DOM on a different thread without problems, what of the DOM implementation is not thread safe? depends on the implementation, but it's easy to imagine that the DOM uses global internal caches and it's not just the DOM but everything the DOM touches canvas, video, you name it true it would be sad if it was not available creating markup is one of the things i'd expect to happen in a worker even if it's not manipulating forms, videos, audio, etc. strings and innerHTML baby gotta save something for HTML6 creating markup with strings is sub-optimal but maybe e4x can find a use finally :-) The JS library writers say it's actually optimal in practice :-) i didn't mean performance-wise :-) bbl",0

It works fine in FF but in IE i keep getting NaN errors ajay, alert(picnic.value); before you assign it that thats strange it's showing up blank .. are there any problems with passing in this in a function in an event in IE? what's 'picnic'? ajay: no what's 'picnic'? picnic is ""this"" passed in in an onchange in a dropdown ok, so is the evented node yeah well, looks fine to me :| is there something different that needs to be done for in IE to get the value of it? http:www.devmatrix.org"") what error are you getting and when? when i change something, it's saying NaN when assigning the value ajay: no, provided the evented node is an input and has a .vaule property the evented node is a select ok then it DOESN'T have a .value property really? its options do, not the select itself what does a select have? oh so how can I find the value of the chosen option? it has an options collection, each has a value in geckos, yes, you can do SELECTELEMENT.value and it references the selected option's value It may be a multiple select, so a single value doesn't make sense oh true which I don't think is standard but how can you find the value of the selected option in IE though? ajay: you iterate the options collection of the select element same works on all browsers really yea but if I iterate through em how can I tell which one was selected? ajay: SELECTHERE.options[SELECTHERE.selectedIndex].value ajay: stop at the first one you find which is selected ajay: you said you had multiple? no it's a single select if there's more than one, you have to iterate ohhh ok ajay: SELECTHERE.options[SELECTHERE.selectedIndex].value <--- that gets it ok sweet thanks same works on all browsers really ok cool. i was looking through docs for the select tag and wasn't really finding anything on getting the value Is there a way to trigger a function when the page loads, without using onload in <body>? window.onload ohh the page... stick it at the bottom of the page :) and say document.body.onload=YOURFUNCTION; that works :) well I hope anyway, I'll try, thanks :) does anyone know how to override oncontextmenu for just a div or anchor? yes and no oncontextmenu=""mystuff()"" however, some browsers by default nowadays are not allowing access to the right-click menu hey by SELECTHERE you mean picnic in my case? ajay: yes i can get document.oncontextmenu = function () {return false;} to stop it for the whole document [1]Andrew: ie, geckos, geckos install with 'do not allow access to context menu' but I can't enable it for the document and turn it off for a div unless the user goes into preferences and js section and changes it I'm only concerned with IE actually [1]Andrew: then use oncontextmenu :) i did and? ehheh you may have to do a return false it only turns off the oncontextmenu for the whole document I don't think so, lemme check my refs I just want it to be effective for a link, or at least a div wrapping a link nope [1]Andrew: oncontextmenu Fires when the user clicks the right mouse button in the client area, opening the context menu. there, from the Div object refs ummm i did parseInt(picnic.options[picnic.selectedIndex].value) and it still returns as NaN so it does it for element interface ajay: what's the value in the selected option? 0,1 or 2 that code looks good to me so, I'd think the NaN bit occurrs elsewhere but when i try alerting that, i get NaN right is not there though, is coming from elsewhere or so.... got an url for it? <a href=""http://www.statc.net/dempsey/new/screen4.htm"">http://www.statc.net/dempsey/new/screen4.htm</a> any of the drop downs with the numbers <option>1</option> <--- there's no .value or value=""1"" lol thus yeah.. i just realized that wow i'm a dumbass you can still grab the 1 by using .text instead but not sure it's what you'd need ^_^, usually a descritive text with a relevant value works better yeah. thanks man. I really appreciate it now I can finally go out and enjoy my saturday night :)",0

"69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: RFC 2781 disagrees with you. what do current browsers do? that is, is it really harmless for existing doctype sniffing and all that? since the BOM arises naturally, it is really really dumb for an author to specify the endianness on the HTTP level. no gain and a possibility to get it wrong not sure what browsers do. I imagine they ignore the BOM though. I guess I should write test cases before discussing this further, but it would be nice not to violate RFCs gratuitously if real-world compat doesn't require doing so looks like rfc2781 make it moot what the html5 spec says, as it is then a violation at the encoding layer, not the parser layer the rfc doesn't require anything of the UAs as far as i can tell it requires the BOM not to have effect, i.e. the decoded stream to include it if the HTML layer wants to chop it off after that, it is being weird of course, this whole thing is about a labeling case that authors should avoid anyway exactly for issues like this as for encoding layer errors vs. html layer errors, I think the spec should do some hand holding for implementors here, because we cannot assume every parser implementor to be a spec lawyer as well i think that in any case a leading BOM should be stripped, whether it is compliant or not it would be the height of uselessness to have the BOM, which authors can't see, imply a <body> i would be a ""gotcha"" whose only clear purpose was to confuse authors, in an area where authors can barely understand what's going on anyway regarding whether it's an error or not, that's only a conformance checker matter really what if the HTTP-level label is UTF-16 and the byte stream has two leading BOMs? the decoded character stream then has one BOM. should the HTML layer drop it? the UTF-16 RFC doesn't as far as i can tell require the leading BOM to be stripped before sending it to the next layer I would say that only the HTML (application) layer strips the BOM hmm. I guess my view here is biased by decoder implementations that do drop the BOM in the decoder when the label says UTF-16. anyway, I think this needs test cases to figure out what the current crop of browsers does and then a bit of spec elaboration plus test cases to help implementors mumbles something about UTF-8 being the one true encoding and UTF-16 and UTF-32 being time sinks for diligent implementors b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: fair enough b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: (note that UTF-8 is not really great for CJK) 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: gzip and a very large chunk of characters in CJK HTML is markup and, therefore, in the Basic Latin block",0

"yeah, though the unordered list is somewhat odd I guess I couldn't figure out a better way to put it back then e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0: it could be still be good to reword that a bit since seems like it has been read in two ways one is that progress fires for all bytes and the last progress may fire too soon and the other is that progress may not fire if load already fired the latter is what the spec says currently actually, seems like webkit has different behavior depending the browser. Chrome does something and Safari something else guess it depends on the network stack but i don't really see how you can read it as if progress can fire after load in any event, please email hopefully I can fix it monday or sunday or some such e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0: well, progress must not fire more often than every 50ms and *if* you want to fire it for all bytes, then load could have been fired already actually, the *if* isn't needed but sure, if you read that all carefully, progress doesn't fire when load is about to fire",0

"b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: dunno if you're around but I wanted to ask if there's a reason why for the V.nu site you aren't serving the static files from jetty I mean the style.css and script.js files a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: this way, I have less need to track Jetty security updates and less need to figure out how to make Jetty serve static files when V.nu has its own main() I've forgotten to update script.js, haven't I? b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: no no I haven't landed the new code yet so you don't need to update yet so I know how to make jetty serve static files a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: I've considered reading style.css and script.js to RAM and serving them from the servlet, though. I just haven't gotten around to it I have the code working in my workspace OK that would be a better solution I guess a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: I'm most worried about Jetty's generic file serving serving other files accidentally yeah well, the reason I'm looking into this is that for the w3c instance I would really like to have everything in one place a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: I'm OK with having the code in the repo a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: not sure if I want it enabled on the V.nu instance without seeing the code yeah, sure, understood and I can put it under the w3c flag I think a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: ok. all of it I'll get you a patch or more to the point, I don't want it enabled on V.nu without seeing the Jetty guts it calls yup understood but now I'm wondering if it's better just to pursue what you mentioned about reading style.css and script.js to RAM and serving them from the servlet b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: btw, is there a way I can detect within the code what path jetty is running under? so that I don't have to use absolute paths right now I'm just feeding it the path through a system property a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: I don't know. There might be a magic system property for it, but I don't see a dedicated JDK API call for it ok b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: what code would I need to touch if I wanted to implement reading style.css and script.js to RAM and serving them from the servlet? a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: nu.validator.servlet.VerifierServlet OK ah b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: doGet? a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: yeah OK a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: you could read the files to RAM from the static initializer a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: it's dirty, but there's already IO from static initializer in the app I see b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: so the code is doing this already for serving /robots.txt right? a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: yeah could this be done for serving image files as well? a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: sure b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: OK, well, if you prefer I can write a patch that does it this way instead of using the jetty static-file serving stuff a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: that would be awesome will do then thanks b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: to be clear, we still need to files in the repo and the code reads them in from the filesystem, right? if so, my next question is, how do I get the path to the directory they're in? a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: I'd read them from the file system to a byte[] from static {} and then serve them from RAM the way robots.txt is served from RAM yup, OK a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: hmm. how are the local entities located... ah yeah oh. they come from within a JAR yup I could do the same for these I guess so one option would be moving the files so that they get baked in a JAR yeah I mean, just use that same mechnaism OK makes sense yup OK hmm. though a JAR *might* make the length of the file unknown oh which will result in some reallocation and copying of byte[] if you can't allocate the right-sized byte[] in advance oh why is that not also a problem for the existing files that get JARed up? oh I see what you mean yeah they don't get read into a file-length byte[] right",0

"well bummer ends up speccing an event that fires on garbage collection that's clearly not a good plan Very interoperable, no doubt :) Would it be non-conforming to just leak memory and not do GC? so here's the problem You'd still be firing it every time you did GC, so it should be conforming this is for http://www.hixie.ch/specs/dom/messages/0.9 what should happen if i create an end point, set its message handler, and then forget about my end of it, having passed the other end to another browsing context? clearly it shouldn't be garbage collected as it can still receive messages and respond usefully but then what happens if my Window is closed? or navigated? Is the strong entangling really needed? should the other side get an unload event for the endpoint? how do you mean? Instead of just having each endpoint have an ""other end"" property referring to the other endpoint i don't understand Um. Well, could you treat it the same way any old DOM reference in a different window? With window references you have .closed, could something similar work for endpoints? i can set .active to false The problematic event was something like ""other endpoint is gone""? i think i've worked out how to spec it for now we'll see if it handles Workers too in a second What's the reason for cloning endpoints sent via postMessage, by the way? cross-origin concerns for example, it would be bad if you could do foreignEndPoint.prototype.prototype.toString = function () { my evil function } or whatever So the create function is usually making one just to throw it away later yep I feel like it should be possible to do it the other way around, creating just one endpoint and having the semantics of send be ""The endpoint received should be a new one entangled with this here local endpoint I have"" what if you do it twice? also, you might want to pass the same end point down several pipes which you couldn't do the way you describe it Aren't those two things mutually exclusive? hm? If you want to pass it down several pipes, you are doing it twice (or more) say you have established pipes A1<->A2 and B1<->B2, and a newly created pipe C1<->C2. right now you can pass C2 down from A1 to A2, and then from there it can go from B1 to B2 but your proposal can't do that, as i understand it however, your proposal would allow sending ""C1's other point"" down A1 to A2 creating C2, and then sending ""C1's other point"" again down A1 to A2, creating C2'? so now you have two C2s which is confusing and causes all kinds of problems Let me work this out. So you pass C2 from A1 to A2, which gives A2 a C3 connected to C1. Then you pass C3 from B1 to B2, giving B2 a C4 which is connected to C1. In the process you've invalidated C2 and C3. yah (i'd prefer the notation C2, C2', C2'', C2''', but sure :-) ) Yeah, I see my idea wouldn't support chaining (Unless the endpoint included a pointer to its twin) And that's what the cloning was supposed to stop yeha yeah, even So I suppose I'd be writing function setupLink(w) { p = new Pair(); w.postMessage(""New pair"",p.two); return p.one; } or somesuch then hmmmmm workers have to die if no browsing contexts refer to them not just if nobody refers to them otherwise you could have a worker refer to another and vice versa and they'd keep each other alive I don't know how to address this comment for selectors api http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapi/2008Feb/0000.html hm, i wrote that text or suggested it originally let's see I can't figure out how to rephrase it to make it clearer yeah User agents should ensure that they do not crash or behave erratically when facing... that might work ... For example, a user agent could apply a timeout to the NSResolver callback. but then I'm not totally convinced of the value of having that in there at all, since the same applies to all scripts well, the difference here is that the script is driving a UA algorithm i could easily imagine implementations of the algorithm where returning inconsistent results would cause a crash this is just saying, ""beware"" which is all security sections ever say, really ok but i can easily imagine someone not thinking about the fact that the resolver might hang, and accidentally not putting the usual scripting timeout constraints around that api same with changing the dom http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/passwordsInTheClear-52 ""User agents SHOULD use password masking when passwords are displayed in an HTML form"" i'm so glad the TAG is addressing critical unsolved problems and not, say, problems from 1993 http://www.hixie.ch/specs/dom/workers/0.9 is finally ready for broader review",0

"Hey Heya, asl? C'mon buddy, do we have to go through with that? Asl is just a really bad pickup line. Yes, we do. Because only stupid people actually answer it and if you're not stupid you're not the one for me. So I guess we have nothing here that's worth developing. Unless you like cake too? I really hate to say it, because you'll probably disconnect and your speech indicates a degree of intellect. But sorry, I'm not particuarly stupid. And I love cake. Damn. And you're clearly not stupid if you like cake! Yeah. And how many people have you gone through to get someone who doesn't type lyk thiiis? Yeah, sorry again. Oh my God Like 40. Woah. I disconnected everytime. I've been through about 5 now. How about you? Makes sense. Ah. I play the game where I correctly grammar their statements with proper typing. <_< It can actually be really difficult. I don't, those people can't be redeemed. Who the fuck are you? I must know, You have proper grammar. This is an extremely rare trait. I am God. I can't help but be in extreme astonishment. Ah. Since we won't meet face to face, just call me that to entertain me. Ah, that makes sense. Sure thing, God. And I'll call you whatever you want as long as it doesn't involve the word ""master"" because that's ended badly before. Can I call you Lord? You can call me Bubbles. Or Mr Finklestein. Sure. I shall call you Mr Bubbles. But I want you to whisper it in my ear. And you're sure you don't wish to play the grammar correction game? tha ciity eyy..hmm..wif u n rushyy .. hmmm..i duno ey haha narr of course mahnn, biin missin yall boiiz ey ye holla at me one tyme ey, u gt my digits ey That's pretty amazing. If I'm going to whisper it in your ear, I'll call you Sweet Nothings. Thanks, God. So you're copying and pasting all this. I assume you've had this conversation before, with someone else? I can deal with that, God. Oh no, I haven't found someone to play it with yet. I can't say I want to play at the moment, I'm afraid. What brought you to Omegle, God? I like the name. What about you Mr Bubbles? Sheer boredom, and desire to affirm my hatred for humanity. I hope you have achieved it. And I hope I have slightly redeemed it. For that's what I'm meant to do, I think. Well, you are God, I suppose. I suppose. Are you a student, God? Anyway, farewell Mr Bubbles. May your adventures be advantageous to you. I am. I will never forget this, Mr Bubbles. Ah, I see how it is. Well, if you desire to depart, It was a pleasure, God. I won't forget this either. Must you leave? It took me forty people to get to you. 40. Forty!",0

"hey e3efb3cc38298422dea69b13461e06e2 hey e3efb3cc38298422dea69b13461e06e2: I think we should shift the test wiki into a a /submit directory e3efb3cc38298422dea69b13461e06e2: since that's what we want to restrict it to e3efb3cc38298422dea69b13461e06e2: that way we can make the top landing page explain all the systems that are set up on that virtual server e3efb3cc38298422dea69b13461e06e2: svn, submission system, development test suite builds, nightly harness build, etc. Sounds reasonable to me I can make that change today can you do that? Since you are already familiar with the directory setup for the wiki ok, cool we need to set up a meeting to discuss requirements for the review system also, we should make sure we storyboard and design the interface for that /first/ before you start hacking since interface is the main reason we're implementing a system at all :) Ok, can we do that on Wednesday after the telcon? probably. We'll want to check with Melinda and Arron Ok, I generally reserve Wednesdays for CSS stuff, so anytime that day ok I'll be working with Arron all next week on test suite stuff, btw. we both blocked out that time so if this wednesday doesn't work too well for anyone, next wednesday should be ok my main concern implementation-wise is whether we can automatically track renamings in SVN I know it keeps history.. but I'm not sure it understands the concept of a rename. as opposed to copy + delete I'll have to look in to that some more... not sure myself once we've got a requirements document and some interface sketches, you and I should talk a bit about implementation details as well :) can do.

"hello at the ""Open Torrents"" screen, I can't figure out how to select or deselect files double clicking on them doesn't work, neither does hitting ""mark selected"" just select one or multiple rows in the table and then hit those buttons or click on the checkbox directly, if it isn't grayed out sorry about asking in the wrong channel, just noticed now. anyhow, that doesn't seem to work the checkboxes just have a dash in them ugh... macos? Linux hrrm... well, i guess the dash means the same as grayed out just leave it as it is and change it in the files tab instead okay how do I get to the files tab after starting the torrent? it's one of the tabs in the torrent details just doubleclick on a torrent in the main view got it",0

"I was using xwinwrap to put things like Flurry and Pinions on my desktop,04 01but then I suddenly saw a diagonal triangle flash on the screen (corner to corner) and then the system hard locked. (XGL in Linux) my question: how likely is it that the video card overheated? It's a GeForce Go 7600, and the only thing that'll give me temps is Rivatuner with the 91.31 driver in Windows. I priced out a DVDRW on a Thinkpad T-42 and IBM wants more than $439 dollars for the thing. This is outrageous. I am not convinced it is worth it because you can buy one for under $200 in a Dell. Does anyone feel differently? You might be able to find slim drives on Newegg that will fit. I looked on Newegg and I couldn't find anything. However, that doesn't mean they aren't there. IBM is outrageously expensive and the conclusion I came to is that if the warranty ever lapses, the laptop is worthless and probably unsellable. Parts are just too high. ""Lenovo"". I guess I should get my termination right. #thinkpad #ibmthinkpad So far I have not been able to find either a slim drive or generic batteries and the conclusion I came to is IBM it outrageously expensive -- worth than apple. Why not get a firewire fullsize burner? If you wish, you could even get one that can be made region-free. What do you mean by region free? Play DVDs from other countries. I am exploring the possibility of selling my computer and buying a new one that is hopefully a less expensive brand than IBM. I haven't made up my mind. I am not convinced that Thinkpads are worth the extra money. They are too expensive. I bought mine used and haven't had it very long, but I would rather have a system that ha duo core, DVD burner, and maybe a little bit bigger hard drive. (Though I'm biased) I like HP. What is different in HP that you like. Hopefully they are less expensive. Thinkpads are ridiculously expensive. The Mac is cheaper. What version of the HP are you using or do you like? IBM seems to have good anti-shock and anti-roll features, but they are behind the times when it comes to using backup CDs with DVD. They are still pushing CDRW which is technologically obsolete for backing up your drive -- unless you want to put in 13 or more disks. Well it is time for me to go to sleep. See you all in the morning. Well, I like the deals HP gives on hardware. This current machine is a Gateway -- it was a gift/scholarship, so I didn't argue brand)",0

"hello hello edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e though that HTMLImageElement.complete was some new feature but apparently browsers already support it in incompatible ways I suppose ""in incompatible ways"" goes without saying... I've used that in Firefox and Opera with no problems (to poll for image loading, since I didn't want to use events), though my code was gratuitously incompatible with IE anyway so I have no idea how it handles complete ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c, what did you use it for? But ""The DOM attribute complete must return true if the user agent has downloaded the image specified in the src attribute, and it is a valid image."" doesn't seem to agree with what I found - I'm fairly sure I had complete==true once the image had failed to load (e.g. with a 404 error) (so I tested width!=0 to see if it had actually loaded successfully, and replaced it with an error image otherwise) used ""javascript:alert((new Image()).complete)"" as testcase That was just in a canvas game, which loaded images while running and only wanted to check for updated status between frames will make some testcases later to test interop a bit better is going to fetch a Wii now! Hmm, I can't work out what I was doing that made it look like it worked, or whether I was just imagining the whole thing... Oh wait, that's because I'm trying .completed instead of .complete, hence it always returning undefined... data:text/html,<script>var i=new Image(); i.src=""http://microsoft.com/404""; alert(i.complete); setTimeout(function(){alert(i.complete)}, 1000);</script> That does what I expected - False at first, then True after it's got the error response but only in FF/Opera - IE returns False/False IE makes more sense imo quotes edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e out of context I can see it on Digg now :p IE isn't as useful since it only allows the polling-equivalent of onload and you can't poll for the same conditions as onerror, whereas FF/O sort of let you tell the difference between complete-successful and complete-error but IE does make more sense for something called ""complete"" afaict the attribute just reflects whether the load event has been dispatched on the element or not i suppose what FF/O is let it reflect whether load or error has been dispatched (but that may be what you just said, I'm a bit dense) That was what I was thinking (and what seems to happen when I test it), though I'm not sure if what I actually said made sense :-) That doesn't seem to be true either alerting complete in a load event handler returns false in IE ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c, it's a security risk... consider an image from an intranet .complete does return true after the load event of the window object is dispatched, but not before... wonders if that can be considered a bug in IE For data URLs? I was thinking that if you are able to call canvas.toDataURL, you are the same person who was calling canvas.drawImage, so you had the Image, so you could read image.src and get the image data out. But I don't know how much cross-domain scripting is allowed, and whether one of those assumptions is wrong ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c, the only way to get the image data is through <canvas> ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c, hence the restriction (the security model of the web is rather odd, but we have to deal with it :)) But when the image is loaded from a data: URL (e.g. because it came from another call to canvas.toDataURL), you can read .src and get the image data without using the canvas at all like by writing a PNG decoder in JavaScript, which I guess is a little painful but theoretically possible I'm not up to speed with data: URIs and security, sorry One thing that is problematic with data: URIs if I remember correctly is when they are the result of a redirect Ah, sounds like that kind of thing makes it awkward http://tc.labs.opera.com/html/img/ has four tests which show that no browser implements the spec And none misimplement it in the same way Test: 1 2 3 4 Firefox: F P P F Opera: F P P DNR IE: P F F P Safari: F F F DNR another <figure> with <credit>: http://www.tellusgame.com/Tellusfilm/2.%20Finished/artikelsidan.html i've noticed that whatever html5 feature i use (usually type=email &c), as soon as i pass the code to someone else it disappears. probably their editors or tools remove them or complain about them or they are dicks and want to pass validator.w3.org http://www.tellusgame.com/Tellusfilm/2.%20Finished/kronikorsidan.html has only <credit> and no caption for the figures firefox seems to be buggy about display:table-cell. sometimes they get rendered on their own line. on reload it renders correctly will try to reproduce with a simpler test case Microsoft just joined the HTML WG With Chris Wilson as their sole participant if Martin Atkins is around, my apologies...

"is there a unix utility that can be used.. to update ACL, similar to the security tab in windows explorer properties? setfacl and getfacl how do you get the security tab to add users? I can't get it to work. well you have to be administrator of that domain for starters for the security tab to even appear or at least authenticated with the same domain that the server is on security tab appears and i can edit or remove acls i set using setfacl, but i can't add new ones what if it's not on a domain? no luck? im not sure why you cant add.. is it all greyed out etc? if I click add and try to list users, it asks me for a username and password, even if i use root it will only list accounts on my local computer so this is on a windows xp/2k machine accessing a linux/samba server? It's winXP. It's probably because it's not on a domain but I don't particularly want to set one up If I have the server and the client connect to a preexisting domain will that have the same effect? i would say so setfacl and getfacl is part of smbclient? no they're part of acl which is? a seperate utility? yes a separate package. you can see if you have it setup but just using getfacl <filename> s/but/by/ I can't seem to find out how you get samba to log onto a domain.

'cause I know what would be there i have restrictions riiiiight off haha you SHOULD :P so i can look at boobies safe search is like wearing a cyber condom.. haha but there are no boobies so whats the use of a condom its like having a plug but no socket so you don't get nasty diseases ;) or have to claw your eyes out iv already told you clamydia doesnt coooount okay, then it's like safety glasses AND a cyber condom. haha well, Chlamydia is bacterial anyway, not a virus, so of course it doesn't that's more like malware.. beer googles blind you can treat it with antibiotics im just trying to unwind alright now lose it aaaahhhhahahaahh go crazy okay :) i have to go my mum just shat herself",0

"oh, nevermind, I just found out the guy was also using a hacked nvidia host nvidia *corporate* host... thats balls WET54G has the sensitivity of a KGB officer. Anyone give me a heads up on equipment that doesn't suck ass? -_- wrt54gl with some hacked firmware but its about as sensitive as a US soldier in iraq... it might kill you and everyone in your extended family. Likely. I prefer atheros radios performance-wise, but they're damned hard to find a truely stable atheros rig without spending entirely too much money Well I am coming from 'back in the day' when a wet11 was shit but still adequate for long haul point to point. bleh I need something that will run into a 24db dish and not fail completely. It was crap but it worked... enough. well, it depends on what you're dealing with if theres say, a canopy system 2 miles in front of your 15 mile link it doesn't matter whatever radio you use, its not gonna work There is no real interference to worry about. Rural 802.11b then I'd say the wrt54gl the best thing I ever did was flip my gear into pure-g mode. Why? If the sensitivity was not bad enough for the linksys product, the noise issues would be enough to can it. Meh. The guy is running B. 802.11b dislikes multipath of any sort be it a tree, a building, whatever just kills throughput and theres not enough throughput there in the first place (to run something commercially viable) 11b has more ""sensitivity"" but it considers a lot more of the signal ""noise"" than 802.11g does in not-quite-perfect-LOS situations Ok, I will keep that in mind when I am playing the part of 'wisp'. Right now I am client. I have no control over that. ;_; Senao 2611CB3+ would be the best choice for 802.11b Ugh. 4:30pm Friday, call comes in. Customer says, ""We haven't been able to load pages very well for the last 3 days."" Great timing. hehe Well 3 days and they just now get around to calling? Does not seem that important. ;) yep haha asdf well I had a customer email me 2 days ago asked me to check out their connection I did, it was fine then like 30 minutes later *poof* they disappeared The customer or the connection? :D I drive by their house (its a RB112 with an AP set up on the 2nd card) and no AP talking so I call... nobody's home leave a message, haven't heard a peep. both the customer *and* Their connection ;) NSA must have got him. ...wait a moment...does this mean you lost a customer? XD Damn black helicopters. Hard enough to make a living w/o your customers being abducted. With abductions you can at least make up the lost revenue via the selling of anal probes. No market here, too many molestors offering them free. Your only choice is to eliminate competition. *nod*",0

"Hey. yassine, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3lfYeNadqk"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3lfYeNadqk</a> Uviz, hi mate do you happen to know how an application can finds it path ? not a servlet a class What do you mean by finding its path? Like a location where it's being run or loaded? lets say i have a class in /opt/blah/MyClass.java and how can MyClass.java knows find out that it is in /opt/blah/ I read an article about this a while ago and it was quite tricky but still not a full-blown solution. im searching but dunno exactly wich term could help Damnit, I went through 150 articles in no avail. Let me search more. me neither :(( :'(( <a href=""http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/javatips/jw-javatip105.html"">http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/javatips/jw-javatip105.html</a> I think the only way to be sure is to device your own class loader management that keeps track of what's loaded, unloaded, and what not. Because the default ClassLoader doesn't keep track of anything unless there has been some feature augmentations to the new framework that I'm not aware of. Where dvayanu and jasonb when we need them? I got home around 8PM today -- really exhausted. no where they sleep :(( ""The java.lang.ClassLoader API is not designed to provide any information about classes loaded by a given classloader instance, and Java classloaders are not required to register themselves in any programmatically accessible way.' So I guess, it all comes down to your own customized ClassLoader. Uviz, <a href=""http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/ant/core/trunk/src/main/org/apache/tools/ant/launch/Locator.java?revision=439418&view=markup"">http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/ant/core/trunk/src/main/org/apache/tools/ant/launch/Locator.java?revision=439418&view=markup</a> Doesn't this class work in conjunction with the rest of the framwork? I mean, is it usable by itself? Smells like a utility class. :) Ya, it actually works. :) Doesn't do much about .jar files. you tired it ? i allmost give it up here :s Ya, I tried my own, it prints out the correct absolute path.

"hrm, wheres a good place to look up if ""disabled"" is a valid attr on <a> in html5 http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/commands.html#dom-command-ro-disabled more elaborately, http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/elements.html the first link suggests that all commands support the disabled attr but i dont believe that <a> does it suggests it's not illegal, but it does suggest it doesn't necessarily do anything, as attributes should be used only when they make semantic sense (go magical phrasing) surely theres a better reference basically disabling an anchor link is meaningless, because that means it's not an anchor link in which case you wouldn't mark up whatever you've marked up with it. yeah, our markup guy is using <a> where <button> would probably be more appropriate i guess to get <a> styling w/o having to write rules that's the whole point of css pick your markup based on what your content represents, then style it the way you want it to look (after first applying a reset stylesheet because browser default inconsistencies) someone else had linked a good html5 reference earlier i wish i book marked it now thanks for your help pomax lates what did it start with?

"hi for what the QModelIndex? what does this class really represent? is there only one way to use it right or what` does anyone have an idea about how to use a qspinbox so that you only use signals fron the buttons or when enter is pressed? tby default QSpinBox emits valueChanged for every character typed in the linedit, which is bad a lot of times. you can use editingFinished for keyboard editing on it. you get that signal when someone presses enter or it loses focus it emits that signal, rather the problem is telling the difference between the line edit and arrows for SIGNAL(valueChanged(int)) why do you need to differentiate between them? i mean the value will change everytime you edit it, just as if you clicked the arrows. exceptions are inserting leading or trailing zeroes that's just it - I don't want to get the new value every time I add one digit in a multi-digit number I just want to signal from the lineedit when enter is pressed <a href=""http://doc.trolltech.com/4.1/qlineedit.html#returnPressed"">http://doc.trolltech.com/4.1/qlineedit.html#returnPressed</a> ugg yeah, I know, but I want the lineedit values *and* the arrow values not sure if it will emit that signal.. spinboxes dont inherit qlineedits the problem is that you can only get singals from the arrow buttons from valueChanged(int) patrickkidd: subclass it, check the conditions and only emit valueChanged when you want it to oh, you were taling about spinboxes when you get that signal, there is no way of know if it came from the lineedit sorry yeah its ok maybe you can catch a QMouseEvent on it though no idea how to differentiate between clicking in the editing field or on the buttons oo, yeah, that's ugly maybe you should submit a feature request for it, some valueChangedByStepping( ) signal would be nice I think I will, actually I've already got a question to commercial support",0

"I'm having a problem using Windows Server Tools with Samba. I'm using Samba 3.0.22 on a fresh install of Kubuntu 6.06.1. When I try to use, well, anything, let's go with User Manager for Domains... I get ""The remote procedure call failed and did not execute."" This is on Windows for Workgroups 3.11, does that make a difference? (personally, I didn't even know WfWG could _issue_ RPCs, let alone have them fail) Also, when I run smbclient //namerica1/admtools (NAMERICA1 is the NetBIOS name of my Samba server) timeout connecting to 127.0.0.1:445 timeout connecting to 127.0.0.1:139 Error connecting to 127.0.0.1 (Operation already in progress) So what could be causing this? This wasn't even close to being listed in samba-doc. AWOSDev, windows for workgroups 3,11 does not support domain logins.. if u are using srvtools.exe run it on a nt or xp machine that is joined to the domain and u must be loggin in as root to use srvtools.exe Then how come every time I log on it says ""You have been logged on to THEDOMAIN1 as awosdev by \\NAMERICA1 with USER privilage."" Windows for Workgroups definitely supports domain log ons. Even MS Network Client for DOS and LAN Manager supports domains. AWOSDev, windows 3.11 does not support domain logins. If I take a screenshot of it saying I'm logged on will you believe me? windows for workgroups --- note the workgroup part why would anyone use windows 3.11 ? Because it works for me and does everything I need it to do? At least on that 586/100 it does. i havent used it in a very long time, but there were no such thing as domain controllers when windows 3.11 was around. srvtools.exe needs to be ran on a nt machine as root user joined to the domain. failing that, try LAM ldap account manager or idealx samba console. they are web based SRVTOOLS is specifically designed to run on Windows 3.11 machines sendro, please look at this: <a href=""http://www.geocities.com/awosdev/DOMAIN.png"">http://www.geocities.com/awosdev/DOMAIN.png</a> Now does WfWG 3.11 support domain logons? From my memory, WFW does support domains I never played with it, though That 14Kb screenshot proves it. AWOSDev: I must admit, I haven't used 3.11 for many years Heck LAN Manager 2.2c supported domains, so any 286 with DOS 5 on it can be logged on. AWOSDev: I'd suggest you contact the mailing list with your question So you can't help me? AWOSDev: I'm afraid not :-( :( AWOSDev: you do win a prize for most unique question, though :-) Hehe :) Well since I highly doubt you could help me with httpd2, I guess I'll be off. Bye! AWOSDev: I keep thinking about installing the TCP/IP pack on my 3.11 machine so that I can use it across the network vance, it's easy just grab TCP32B.EXE from FTP.Microsoft.com and you're off. AWOSDev: but some little voice keeps telling me to leave my 386 alone - I'd hate to break it after 15 years without problems.... I know, I'm trying to figure out how to get TCPTSR working on my 8088 you talk about ""doesn't support domain"" :P AWOSDev: I'm not even sure I could get a file from the internet onto that computer :-) It always freezes when it attempts to obtain a DHCP lease :-) Ah come on, it's a whole 20MB drive! A WHOLE 20MB! Do you remember when 20MB was a 'whole' 20MB? I've still got a 120 MB harddrive in that machine.... And had to pay extra for the memory upgrade in that thing, 512K to 640K :P installable in sets of eight ;-) Eh, it runs Windows 3.0 in CGA mode. It's useful for *something* I can play Solitare. slowly... :-) Anyhow, I have to get back to work No actually it isn't that bad for a 7.12MHz Okay, bye! AWOSDev: but you definitely made me smile for the day :-) Well I'm glad :) I'm sorry I couldn't return the favour :-( That's alright. I'll eventually figure it out It might involve a long night with Windows 98 Installer, but I will :P Bye! vance, I agree unique question..",0

"wyrd33: That very much depends on what it is. If it's an application, longer waits are more acceptable on initial load wyrd33: If size becomes an issue, pack the code wyrd33: Often you can get it down to one third the size gzip ftw yup I am working on an application where I so far have about 400kb of uncompressed js When removing comments and unneeded whitespace I get to about 200kb if I pack that I get about 150kb if I gzip that it gets down to a lot less definately under the pain limit Now, what's the size difference between gz and (-comments)+pack+gz? I havent measured it yet since we arent anywhere close to releasing it yet It cant be much but the comments removal and packing is mainly because the boss is paranoid and hasnt understood that basicly you cant hide javascript I dont care as long as I can just make those things part of my normal buildscript What about using Dean Edwards's packer? I do Ah. The perl version Kewl. For size yes. Other than that I dont see the point People who can understand the code are good enough to be able to come up with it themselves Especially for large applications where everything is bound together in wierd ways Are you talking about obfuscation? I brought it up in relation to compression. yes. The boss wants the packer because of the obfuscating ability Oh. Not that anyone cant just unpack it No, of course not. That would be unthinkable... 8-) And I really dont care to make a real obfuscator You'd be wasting your time anyway. indeed It's like the encryption on DVDs... you have to hand the end-user the key, the lock and what you've locked. But the ood thing about JS is that the people who are able to break the encryption, dont need to Locked away, perhaps. True. They can much more easily reverse engineer it And in the process adapt it to their needs munter: the reason i was asking is that the prototype and scriptaculous libs seem fairly large wyrd33: They are. Cut down on the parts you don tuse Or use jQuery. jquery? <a href=""http://jquery.com/"">http://jquery.com/</a> Its just yet another abstraction layer It's a different library altogether with the primary goal being able to pack as much as they can in as little space (around 10K) as possible. I prefer do code in javascript, not in jQuery, scripaculous or whatever they are all called I'm not getting into which one is ""better"", since that's a stupid argument anyway, but jQuery is certainly smaller (and probably has proportionately fewer features). ah.. im more or less looking for effects though in 10k i can do a LOT of stuff moo.fx looks pretty good for only 3k, and they have ""prototype.lite"" which is also 4k Munter: Go ahead, no one's stopping you. :-) How about a tree menu in ~20 lines? How much space would that take with any of thos libs? *shrugs* im just starting to familiarize myself with them, but creating drag and drop between two menus (lists) is two lines of code with scriptaculous correct, that takes a bit more if you do it yourself yeah However i did it anyway, because I had to do drag/drop across frames browsers do cache the javascript files though, right? They do As long as they're regular .js files, yes. so if you have gzip enabled with your CMS or your own homebrew php framework (or lang of choice), it should decrease the size even further, right? yes Yuh. so 150kish is acceptable then? im still trying to get a feel of what the standard is That depends on your audience and their expectations 150kb is not acceptable for a website imo hmm, i see all the frameworks i've looked at with capabilities such as drag and drop are fairly large However, for some type of application, where the user possible gets a loading screen or something like it, it might look different Thats because those frmeworks tend to come with the kitchen sink Just cut them unless some license prevents you from it well, for the drag and drop stuff it'd be more or less for an admin menu looking at scriptaculous drag and drop .. it depends on their effects.js, which is another 30k. so splitting those scripts obviously wont happen i'll take another look at dojo",0

"morning all i was just wondering how u guys implemented change management? i mean assuming there are 2 or more sysadmins .. how do u guys go about documenting the fact that you changed this file's contents this line form a 0 to a 1 for example; so that the other sysadmin(s) know about these changes. thanks after the action we update /modifications file, after the login you`ll last 10 rows from this file see* dd/mm/yy name action the problem is you can forget :) Coques: true Coques: i was thinking more along the lines of a wiki .. thing is in a stable environment changes are very rare .. and so by human nature ppl get lazy to look at the wiki .. or update the wiki sure have u tried script ? e.g. if you use /modifications file you could make an alias for ""exit"" command which forces you to update this file :) as in a redirect to vi /var/log/system-modifications file :) ..nice .. ... hmm maybe not for minor actions but if you filter such command as ls,*display it could only force you to update it when you run more destructive commands i was thinking more along the lines of the program called script .. put in a shell script and use that shell script as the login program instead of /usr/bin/ksh .. whatcha think? ok, you launched vgexport? yes, update the file! :) yes, something like this i`m thinkig to do the same on my servers oh .. u mean per program ? thats a lot of work ;) no no :) just filter list commands no i mean this: script (1) - make typescript of terminal session its a program thats available oh .. u mean type exit .. which is actually not a command any more .. and it will grep .sh_history for a regexp .. if it hits something important then .. ask to update the modifications file? yes, something similar :)) but what about vi .. there will be a lot of ""false positives"" with that yeah.. and vi is used quite a lot .. some of the sysadmins use it to view files instead of cat|pg|more teach your admins! vi <> view Coques: i m the newest and not the most senior ;) heheh which is why script no user interaction necessary but it doesnt capture vi changes .. tho i will know it was opened ..hmm.. need some thought i don`t know better tracking but forge for wiki, nobody will open one window more forget* Egyptian[Home] what about CVS or SVN? :D Coques: unless its autocommit .. it ownt work i made a cvs server on NT (coz they wanted it) for the devleopers and installed the tools on thier machines and everything was set up for them including permissions and domain and they dint use it .. the extra step of committing was too much for them.. the server was eventually formatted a month later again human nature lol you could include it to login/logout script the initial commit would be humongous.. i'd like to have everything except oracle in there a key loger thats what i need }:) this is known problem with more roots everywhere nevernding story how to solve it.. gtg",0

"heycam: That issue fails to mention that it accepts strings like ""nonemeet"" too http://www.ecma-international.org/news/PressReleases/PR_Ecma_finalises_major_revision_of_ECMAScript.htm Hey :) Is someone from the html5lib for Python here? 438e0bbfeb945171b0ba181a7ec56cec: Yes great :) ""TC39 members will create and test implementations of the candidate specification to verify its correctness and the feasibility of creating interoperable implementations"". I wonder if they mean interoperable implemetations that can ship on the web So basically I want to know Do I get the lxml.html parser with this : html5lib.HTMLParser(tree=treebuilders.getTreeBuilder(""lxml""))? b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: Try reading the next sentence ""The test implementations will also be used for web compatibility testing to ensure that the revised specification remains compatible with existing web applications."" ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: Oh. 438e0bbfeb945171b0ba181a7ec56cec: No - that uses html5lib's HTML5 parser (and constructs an lxml document from it), not lxml's non-standard HTML parser 438e0bbfeb945171b0ba181a7ec56cec: Yes, unless you use the latest svn in which case the best option is to use html5lib.parse(input, tree=""lxml"") Well what now? Oh, sorry, I misunderstood the question 438e0bbfeb945171b0ba181a7ec56cec: What do you actually want to do wait http://paste.pocoo.org/show/ad9DwVRGDKIhXNgqSk8j/ is not doing very well at reading at the moment I want to parse my blog with the html5lib and then scrape it with the resulting elementtree Unfortunately I don't really find any documentation for the ElementTree except http://effbot.org/zone/pythondoc-elementtree-ElementTree.htm#elementtree.ElementTree.ElementTree-class 438e0bbfeb945171b0ba181a7ec56cec: That looks vaugely sensible. What is the problem? http://paste.pocoo.org/show/KHOsRJHJNnHNvS9ec0Bg/ that should work doesn't though http://codespeak.net/lxml/tutorial.html http://paste.pocoo.org/show/ld7f4BUjcUZbnyFG4vGd/ ah... the case.. findall()? yes and I DO need to supply an argument which argument do I need to supply to find all tags? . ? if you just want all the child nodes you can just do ""for item in element:"" etree.findall("".//*""): that works aswell thanks though b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea :) Is the argument which I pass to findall called a ""xpath""? ElementPath found it.. sorry I seem to ask only stupid questions 438e0bbfeb945171b0ba181a7ec56cec: If you know xpath and are using lxml you can do element.xpath(xpath_expression) Or I can just use the ElementPath? http://effbot.org/zone/element-xpath.htm e.g. element.xpath("".//a"") finds all a descendants 438e0bbfeb945171b0ba181a7ec56cec: ElementPaths are like a subset of XPath 1.0 Hrmm, I don't think I do need full xpath support, thanks for the tip though b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea, I read on the lxml.html documentation about the following function: *method .text_content(): Also if you use a really up to date lxml you can probably get CSS Selectors this isn't available in the lxml etree, right? 438e0bbfeb945171b0ba181a7ec56cec: html5lib just generates an lxml tree. It has all the features of whichever lxml you have installed well, yes the problem is lxml.html the html Etree is a special tree How do I tell html5lib to use the lxml.html tree? Oh, yeah b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: I don't think the .text_content() method exist in lxml.etree Is there any way to use the lxml.html tree? So, I don't think you can at the moment because of some weirdness in the way that lxml is set up I think this would be really comfortable for webscraping At least that is my recollection from when I implemented this stuff a while ago etree.tostring(node, method='text') might be similar to node.text_content() yeah, that should be in the ballpark It's something like you can't create comments in lxml.html or... .xpath("".//text()) works .xpath("".//text()"") thanks I found in the lxml.html implementation the following _collect_string_content(self) should work if there is no other way the .text attribute works beautifully ..not 438e0bbfeb945171b0ba181a7ec56cec: for <a><b>foo</b>bar</a> a.text == None b.text == ""foo"" b.tail ==""bar"" is there any way to get the whole text and protect the formatting? for example replace <br> with \n 438e0bbfeb945171b0ba181a7ec56cec: Not an easy way that I know of hrm You would need to walk the tree, normalize whitespace and make whatever replacements you want http://paste.pocoo.org/show/5gbDet52tiXSMRWkLZ4y/ ? That will only do children of the td yes that's what I want actually sorry if I start to get annoying but why doesn't that work: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/cfmGTUkDaWSCr1ehDH3X/ ? Trying to get the ""blockquote"" attribute of a ""blockquote"" element? well.. kinda ^^ It works in BeautifulSoup :D... Er, what does it do? I mean if you really have <blockquote blockquote=something> I guess it should work it should get me the text WITHOUT markup WITH formatting out of the blockquote tags >IN BETWEEN HERE< with formatting without markup? how? well for example 438e0bbfeb945171b0ba181a7ec56cec: If you just want the test you can do element.xpath("".//text()"") b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: You don't need XPath for that! Peh! <pre>That's some fancy text <br>comment'</pre> Should result to If you want to do some formatting on the text you need to decide what formatting you want That's some fancy text comment a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554, what should I use? b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: return etree.tostring(element, encoding=unicode, method='text', with_tail=False) is better than that I can't acces this function And implement that by e.g. walking the tree replacing <br> with ""\n"" and adding the .tail of the br to the right place a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554: Define ""better"" b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: Quicker b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: The result is identical :P a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554: Seems unlikely to be a problem in this case It is much longer to type and easier to get wrong (maybe) just wraps it in a function :P etree doesn't got the attribute .tostring 438e0bbfeb945171b0ba181a7ec56cec: from lxml import etree I originally only wanted to import html5lib :|..",0

"for some reason, I've started receiving emails from www-xml-blueberry-comments, but I'm not even subscribed to that list.

"Microsoft just filed a bug on <canvas>: http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=9189 told them to :-) Does anyone know if they'll be implementing it in IE9, or what? I assume they know, but nothing has been announced Given the detail that they're reviewing the spec in, I assume it's because they're either implementing it or planning to implement it at some point in the future I figured that much, but I wonder if it's for IE9 or 10. Actually, have they even announced when IE9 will be released? Even approximately? has no idea was told to come here for html5 canvas inquires is that correct? 8f86c83f5ef08675a18fb5952b608d6b, yes, this is one place you can ask about that. i have a drawing program that works, fine but since it is a mobile, app it broke. noticed line 7 of the following makes the code fail http://pastebin.com/fvRpPFeu need to figure out how to not use ""context.beginPath();"" but lines are still anti-aliased 8f86c83f5ef08675a18fb5952b608d6b: It's not clear what that code is meant to be doing It sounds like you're calling it each time the user clicks somewhere? If you don't call beginPath, then every time you call lineTo you're making the current path get longer and longer and each time you call stroke() you're re-drawing every line segment that's ever been added to that path MikeSmith: am now yes it is based o this code: http://devfiles.myopera.com/articles/649/example1.js which might be what makes it look non-antialiased (because it's overdrawing the lines) What you probably want is to do beginPath, and then moveTo with the *previous* mouse coordinates, and then lineTo with the current mouse coordinates so that each time you're just drawing a single line between the previous and current mouse positions Hmm, that example seems to do it wrong (it never resets so it'll stroke longer and longer paths) the weird thing is that drawing works, without ""context.beginPath();"" but once uncommented, it fails to display If you just call beginPath and then lineTo, it's not drawing a line from somewhere to somewhere because you've only given it a single point which is why you first need to moveTo the previous point how would I moveTo previous point? was chatting with another developer, and he said he does not even use ""context.beginPath();"" to draw lines... how would I be able to do that? You need to add some global variables and store ev._x and ev._y in them each time you draw, and then use those values in a moveTo the next time you draw (after beginPath and before lineTo) If you don't use beginPath then you'll never reset to an empty path, so you'll have the problem of repeatedly drawing over the early parts of the path (which is an easy mistake because it's hard to notice, but it eventually makes things go really slow and look ugly) simply need to anti-alias anything drawn... what is the best way? this is the sample code working, but without anti-aliasing http://devfiles.myopera.com/articles/649/example1.html It is antialiasing, but it's got this overdraw problem because it never resets the path so if you move mouse a hundred times then the first part of the line will have been stroked a hundred times and the antialiased grey gets drawn a hundred times and turns black which is why it looks aliased kinda confused... If you say: ctx.strokeStyle = 'red'; ctx.moveTo(0, 0); ctx.lineTo(100, 0); ctx.stroke(); ctx.strokeStyle = 'green'; ctx.lineTo(100, 100); ctx.stroke(); then it will stroke the first line segment in red, and then it will stroke *both* line segments in green because they're both still part of the current path and that's what that example is doing (except it's a lot more than two line segments, and it's stroking them all in black) i need lines to look like this: http://caimansys.com/painter/index.html not generic looking... goes away for a while",0

I wondered if there's an overlap with your thinking on <dialog> 88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762: ping 6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf, pong. 88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762: about http://html5.org/specs/dom-range.html#range-behavior-under-document-mutation and splitText what if textnode's parent is null Don't I handle that explicitly? ""If old node's parent is not null, . . ."" 88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762: you handle not-null case but where is the is null That's a corner case, so nothing special happens. Regular range mutation rules apply. IIRC I used to handle it, but decided it was pointless to worry about it. hmm Often you can't do better than the default behavior anyway. Since the range can't span the two text nodes. 88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762: so what if you split text between the boundary points If the parent is null? Exactly what Gecko does now: any boundary point after the offset you're splitting at is clamped to the end of the node. There's no special case then. ah ok a bit hard to read but ok I mean the draft What wording would you suggest? well, I was assuming that since there is the ""If old node's parent is not null"" case, there would be also the ""is null"" case Would you assume that when reading code? If it doesn't give the case, it's not there. This is really just pseudocode. well, there is the other case defined ""User agents must run the following steps whenever they execute splitText()"" Right, just sometimes they do nothing. Of course, the horrible way this is written is a hack to work around the fact that we haven't merged it into DOM Core yet. well, they need to update the boundary points when parent is null that is not ""do nothing"" It's ""do nothing extra"". the draft doesn't say that do something, but when splitText() is called, do something extra It says UAs have to run the steps as though they were written at the end of splitText(). Earlier than that, splitText() replaced data and probably inserted a node. That already triggered different mutation rules. I have a note there that points this out explicitly: ""Thus they must be executed after following the range mutation rules for any changes to data or insertions that the method caused."" Also, one of the steps is ""Let original offset equal what the boundary point's offset was before this splitText invocation replaced the data of node."" That doesn't make any sense if you didn't already have range mutation rules running beforehand. I'd ask for suggestions to make this clearer, but it will be moot once it's merged into DOM Core. a lot clearer would be to add just the case for null parent or at least a link A link to what? to the part of the spec which says what to do when parent is null You do nothing extra when the parent is null. this is about readability of the spec not correctness Readability is a mess because it's trying to hack extra steps onto DOM Core when DOM Core doesn't provide hooks for it. This will be solved when DOM Range is merged into DOM Core, so this will just be an extra step or two in the splitText() algorithm itself.",0

"so i wonder how to define sandboxes such that if you have document A with iframe containing document B with iframe containing document C that: 1. if A, B, and C are from the same origin, B can't play with C hm wait i was going to say that if B and C have hte same origin but aren't the same as A they should be able to talk but no, that would still allow problems so we really do want unique origins... hmm that makes it easier HMM. ponders so I assume you are thinking sandboxes that still have script enabled? (since for noscript iframes this would not matter) maybe I should step back and ask what use cases you are targetting actually same-origin matters even without scripts a bunch of things use the origin concept but yes, i am considering scripts too like frame targetting? yeah, that sometimes uses origin I think the desired restrictions depend on the use cases ones I can imagine: - blog comments - user-authored content in a profile on a social network site - ""widgets"" embedded from off-site - ""widgets"" hosted by the provider of the page containing them - ads comments and other user-contributed content, gadgets (same site and other site; including ads), and (not sandboxing but still <iframe> related) client-side includes are the main ones ads are complicated because at least some ad networks consider it important to support frameless flash ads that overlay the content but anything that can overlay the content is not properly sandboxed by definition there are indeed various scenarios with varying levels of sandboxing http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/sandbox has my current strawman proposal (cut and pasted from the start of the e-mail i'm writing; note that i've used past tense because it'll be past tense once i send the mail, but the spec isn't actually updated yet) for comments you would like them to be able to size naturally and seem to be inline as far as the end-user is concerned, but they should not be able to css position outside their area yeah the comments would be <iframe sandbox=""unrestricted-origin"" seamless src=""data:text/html,(small html document)""></iframe> I'm thinking about whether inheriting styles and applying outer stylesheets may be a security risk in certain cases it is in others not so much i can't see how it could be in a script-limited blog comment case I'm thinking for the comment use case and the user-generated content on hosted profile page use case oh i have to disble forms too while i'm at it and also plugins probably yeah (including Java) updated sandbox file I am nervous about the performance impact of using an iframe per comment with hundreds of comments yeah me too i'm not sure what else to do though navigating the parent should be restricted (dunno if that falls out of other things), including back/forward window sizing and positioning should be restricted any browsing context navigation outside the sandbox is blocked does embedding further subframes in the content need to be restricted? though that does mean that links in comments won't work or do they just inherit the sandbox restrictions already in effect? i don't see why it should be, but they certainly are also sandboxed and they're not in the same sandbox, either links in blog comments not working is kind of a bummer perhaps there should be a way to turn that on, since it can't be used as an annoyance in the noscript case yeah comments would now be <iframe sandbox=""unrestricted-origin force-links-to-parent"" seamless src=""data:text/html,(small html document)""></iframe> it's getting long the keywords are a bit verbose it's a security thing, i'm worried about making them too simple i'm especially worried about making them sound like they _increase_ security when all the keywords decrease it somewhow perhaps there should be two addtributes sandbox="""" or restrict="""" that turns everything off, and an allow="""" attribute to turn things back on selectively or sandbox-exceptions="""" well ""force-links-to-parent"" isn't really an exception or a restriction, it just changes the rules to send all user-activated links to the parent browsing context you could achieve that with <base target=""parent""> and allowing targetted links to parent only a bit more work but makes it strictly an exception, not a behavior change (<iframe seamless sandbox allow=""..."" src=""data:text/html,(small html document)""></iframe> makes sense, but i'm not sure what the keywords would be) though if it is not a restriction or an exception perhaps it should be a separate attribute like seamless well the idea is that you can allow whatever random content in the sandbox as you want so i'm not sure i want to be poking <base> into it ooo wait! it can just be part of seamless' behaviour! for the comment use case presumably the data: URL is generated by software and the user's comment does not have <html> or <body>? oh interesting comments would now be <iframe sandbox=""unrestricted-origin"" seamless src=""data:text/html,(small html document)""></iframe> again is it ever useful to allow gadgets to navigate the parent or open a window? probably, but i want to start with as small a set of allowed behaviours as possible I guess for gadgets, anything forbidden can be selectively exposed via postMessage eah y maybe seamless should base its origin determination on the ""real"" origin, not the origin affected by sandbox="""" 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: i think the seamless navigation rule should only apply to navigations triggered by the content of the iframe as opposed to what? 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: if the parent doc navigates a seamless iframe it should not navigate itself hm, that makes things more complex why would you use target="""" on a seamless iframe? why not just change .data? or .src or whatever changing .src is a navigation not per spec oh actually it is nevermind i'm thinking of <object> well put it this way, changing iframe.src, changing iframe.contentWindow.location, and targetted link aimed at iframe all go at the same code path at least in WebKit yeah spec too ok well i could just do it for <a> links knowing the source frame of a navigation is not a big deal i guess we always have to know anyway though what do you call the source if someone from another iframe clicks a link using .click() ? or what if frame A calls .click() on a link in frame B which has a target="""" to A, which is seamless? I would say only cases where the source frame is the seamless frame itself should get retargetted sure but what is the source frame in that example? I don't know in general what a cross-frame click() call on a link considers the source frame presumably something has to define which it is in any case I don't think it matters which is chosen from security POV since A has to have unrestricted origin in your scenario and thus could just modify B to do something bad well i've never had to define it before now :-) but i agree it doesn't really matter much so long as it is defined i guess i'll just add an ""argument"" to the ""navigate"" algorithm and make all the call sites say what the source is defines the term ""source browsing context"" (better terms welcome) hm, this causes <meta http-equiv=refresh> inside a seamless iframe to navigate the parent iframe oh hey, we do need this, to define .referer better :-)",0
"anyone know if Arabic Ta?Â°kÆÂ´l, Hebrew Niqqud, or other non-CJK languages would use ruby for marking up phonetic annotations or diacritics? 1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f: Richard Ishida would know I seem to remember some examples in ruby supplementary docs of non-Chinese/Japanese languages that had ruby annotations but I dunno remember where a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: youâÃÃ´ll be thinking of the dodgy abbreviation WWW and expiry date in Ruby Annotation I bet yeah I need to ping Richard, heâÃÃ´d definitely know. will email him ? abbr as ruby: http://www.w3.org/TR/ruby/#simple-ruby1 ruby as formatting hack: http://www.w3.org/TR/ruby/#complex a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: apart from that IâÃÃ´ve only found Chinese & Japanese examples.

South Korea is basically moving to all hangul, but I think they still use about 1000 hanzi. North Korea supposedly completely stopped teaching them in like the 60s but then reintroduced them due to Chinese donâÃÃ´t know any Koreans I can ask :( they still use a lot of hanzi in Korean, from what I have seen while visiting there e.g., many buildings have names written in hanzi and such and 20-years-olds or so still know many kanji I think they still teach them in high school but I suspect in Korean the logograms all have only a single reading so the reading is unambiguous, and they wouldn't need ruby for showing phonetic readings I think well, assuming you know how to read them ;-) wonder if they have hanzi/hangul/romanisation on eg train signs. donâÃÃ´t remember 1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f: what are you writing that article on? 4c681049601b3c374f1d2c0077c99049: HTML5 ruby, for HTML5Doctors ruby! sweeet itâÃÃ´s killing me >_< ruby and rt are so sexy emoticon fail that should be the Japanese ÃÂºÃ»ÃÂºÃ¸ÃÂºÃº emoji 4c681049601b3c374f1d2c0077c99049: like I said, i18n and a11y are bad enough on their own. combining them ouch",0

And it won't fit in 50px. ? They didn't. so html is quiet gay HTML is not a layout language! it works with 80 pixels great dorward thanks for helping ;) bye htMl (markup), cSs (style) :) deep The deepest.

So, I propose we use the time (either in a call or not) to actually close out some issues. 5059ecaa4fb3ab1183f267bf1613010e: ok, sure Would you prefer working over the phone, or should we just work ad hoc and I can send you some of my suggested text for the various issues? 5059ecaa4fb3ab1183f267bf1613010e: the latter 5059ecaa4fb3ab1183f267bf1613010e: sorry, having browser problems, but I'm here and working on d3e ok, that sounds like a plan. i've got a bit of time this morning i can work on some d3e. then i have a block of the afternoon set aside tomorrow that i hopefully can do even more. I'd like to set the goal of being able to announce last call next week. WFM :-) easy for me to say ... :-) Should be doable, all of our issues at this point are editorial in nature. We haven't had an accepted functional issue in a while.",0

"yup, understood and then you want a couple more and have a raidz*12 and then you lose 2 disks and then people shout lots ;) depends how many disks you feel is safe in a set really well, in the 12x combo, I could actually loose 3, but that's also the penalty I've had to pay to get up to 12 the zfs-add-more-raidzs way did raidz2 make it into 6/06? how could you lose 3? i was talking about if you could extend so not a raidz*8 and 2 raidz*2 oh right, sorry, read that too fast well, I guess the short answer is, this rather..different..way of doing things, would work for the moment, and hopefully I'll be talking about adding disks more like 6-12 months down the road, and with some luck, online expansion will be intergrated by then It would just be nice to know that this is likely before going ahead and deploying this Is hot spare working in Raidz on update2? or did that not make it in? what kind of hardware are you using Gr|ffous ? sorry river/postwait, I'm not sure. I'm running a BFU in most cases arent you going to need to buy a new enclosure anyway so it would make sense to just grow it by adding another 8 disk shelf and raidz nah, external array ah ive not even thought about how to use it with proper arrays yet :) I guess the thing that bothers me, is visualising just where my data is going. I like to know that from a performance standpoint, I have all my data going across my nice 8 drive array. If I end up doing things like [Raidz*8 + Raidz*2].... well, where's is going? striped over both which is why id stick to equal size sets and sure, zfs will just 'take care of it for me', but this is one of the fundemental things that bothered me about lvm. Sure, my swap is in there somewhere... but is it at the beginning of the disk, or the end? is it on the fast disks, or the slow ones? *shrug* which doesn't lend itself nicely to small upgrades :( I hear what you're saying, thank-you, you are being most helpful - but do you at least see what I'm trying to say? yeah i can see your point and indeed for home use with a couple of disks id probably want to grow from say 4 to 8 I won't be able to sleep at night!! but im not sure the risk of growing from 8 to bigger is worth it when you have a proper budget etc ;) just tell people they need to buy 8 more rather like now in fact.. Must head to bed and yeah im wondering how zfs copes with the start of my disk being twice as fast as the end i expect it doesnt Yeah, 8 might not be the best example for the case I'm trying to make. pixie__, it really doesn't care. that's a driver issue if its a highend ish array could you resize the luns one at a time guess that would have the same effect as adding 2 more disks worth of space kind of :) g4lt-mordant yeah but with ufs i can put things i want to be quick at the start with zfs it goes wherever copy on write sticks it at the time still, the advantages of zfs are worth it i guess :) so basically, you're attempting to enhance performance based on a broken driver, then complaining it won't work with another fs? broken driver? so just to be clear on this, if you have 2 raidz's in a pool, zfs will attempt to 'raid50' them? every disk has differetial speeds based on position on platter. most disk system drivers average the speeds ok will file a bug for the sata driver ;) Gr|ffous prettymuch I do remember reading a blog entry about zfs being very aware of the disk geometry, and using a scheduler specifically designed to minimise head moment relative to the priority of the read/write requests in the disk queue which I thought was freaking awesome ive not run into any problems with it yet tbh , its just something thats been nagging away at me :) but that's a slightly different issue",0

"microconversation on microformats :-) greetings People talking in here! Scary :) it's a bit quiet actually, i have a question I am looking at the RSS enclosure spec which would be really kinda useful to me for an app i am writing. http://is.gd/3nStQ -- my purpose... my purpose is to embed into a blob of HTML something which can be automatically detected and which links to another object elsewhere, providing a little meta information - size, type... is there something more refined than the enclosure tag ? Use the <object> include pattern? That is, have the original thing use an <object> to link to the informative html blob. maybe atom rel=""enclosure"" which has a lot of magic the blogs of data are inside atom documents. alecmuffet - do you have a URL to an example of this in the wild? not yet it's a new app :-) hmm - your description sounds a bit too abstract at its simplest, you can just use a hyperlink to link to more data yes. denoting that particular link as an enclosure, as opposed to any other link in the document, is the issue start with just http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-enclosure bwahahahaha.... i shall go beat up kevin, then. thanks! and if you want to mark up more of the embedded media object (I assume that's what you likely mean, since your example of ""blob of HTML something"" is fairly abstract) use hMedia http://microformats.org/wiki/hmedia which uses rel-enclosure inside",0

I thought that building xen is supposed to be with gcc on solaris dunno, I haven't tried to do that yet my test box got... reappropriated :/ this page : <a href=""http://opensolaris.org/os/community/xen/How-To-8-15-06/Downloads/"">http://opensolaris.org/os/community/xen/How-To-8-15-06/Downloads/</a> says that you must have # SUNWgcc # SUNWgccruntime installed for buiding xen let's put it other way: how do I know ig a packackage contains cscope? I want to check if also SUMWgcc includes cscope which seems possible or SUNWgccruntime ? any ideas? SUNWspro is where I have cscope cscope is in SUNWspro cscope-fast is in SUNWonbld quasi, also me but are you sure there is no cscop in SUNWgcc or SUMWgccruntime? Yes. richlowe, anyhow I assume that I should add it to path AFTER the path to the gcc binaries because as I undestand Xen on solaris should be built with these gcc binaries and NOT SUNWspro binaries the two don't conflict in naming. richlowe, OK (I was afraid there was a confilict ) god , added SUNWspro to the path and now ; ""/usr/sfw/bin/gas: unrecognized option `--divide' gas --crop-dust isn't gas forbidden by Geneva law?

I can't say any genre but I LOVELOVELOVE Pendulum! :D u? haha thats funny! i love all kinds of music. mostly rock, but ive been getting into hip hop r&b stuff for the last year ive never heard of Pendulum. listening to a song of theres right now :O what song? :D watercolour. im liking this! haha! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogMNV33AhCY this is better! =D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mYd2X_9rrs wow their vids are kinda trippy. and i love that sound. it reminds me of a band called Moneta. Their earlier stuff sounded like the keyboards Haha :DD I love too! Before I heard them song the Island, I was into pop, r&b, hip hop and rap... but now I listen only Pendulum :D Never heard of Moneta :D they were a local band who just got signed in seattle, but they disbanded about 2 months ago. oh, okay :D Pendulum makes very good music for downhill skiing! :D hahah i would never think of that! you have never skiied? :O nope. haha WHAT?? U really need to try it! a friend of mine says that too haha :D so listen to us! :D so im guessing skiing is a love of yours? lol yeah, that too :D well it mostly rains where im from so snow/skiing season isnt really around very long here You can always travel to place where season is longer :D like siberia! HHA :D:D well that's not maybe very good idea there is no good skiing centers hahaha! Canada it is Maybe :D I don't know, never been there me neither but my sister told me that the Alps are very good :D like by france and germany? or the Appalachian mountains in the States? noo, Austria maybe one day ill have to do that. but considering im in the wrong hemisphere it might be a while haha Haha :D so what do you do when your not chatting with strangers?

I work too, but just sometimes, when I need money, not so often Haha :D I've missed so many days that I can't compute. im guessing youre not an adult then who has to support yourself? haha sounds like my girlfirend. she misses alot of school My parents :D but all I need to say is that I'm sick and I don't have to go to school :D haha! thats all i had to say to my mom too. but she knew i wouldnt stay home unless i really needed to. plus my mom and i didnt get along when i was still living with her so she definitely knew that i wouldnt stay home if i didnt have to lol Hah :D well we live so far away of everything so i stay at home every time... And I sleep whole day so.. Haha ::D i can only sleep alot when im really sick. thats because at first i cant se\leep for about a day or more and then at some point i passout I could sleep whole day everyday if my brother would let me why wont your brother let you sleep lol I don't know... He just wants to be so annoying... damn punch him in the shin thatll stop him haha no it wont :D hahha And my dad too won't let me sleep your like my roomate. if everyone leaves you alone you'll sleep forever. its almost 3 in the afternoon and my roomie is still asleep the good thing is i think hes got work in an hour so i can wake him up with REALLY LOUD music. i think ill try a new Pendulum song lol Hahm, yeah, that's me :D Thats terrible xd Well I'm sure that he will wake up then :DD i dont do it to him very often anymore so he'll only be a little mad :D",0

What are you trying to do? columns or rounded corners? searchin for a design detail that could be done via css Any in particular? i readed about all those gradient,letter press,gradients css3 effects that looks to be easily implemented dunno. maybe rounded corners+gradient I'm not sure I would count CSS as HTML5 so i could just add them and dont have to design an image hmm indeed i'm on #html5 too Here's the first result on Google for ""css rounded corners"" http://www.css3.info/preview/rounded-border/ i dont like trends anyway. yes 7e92afba2b833719d96dfb3a3e624739:) i know google Here's the first result on Google for ""css gradient"" http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/ colorzilla's link is pretty good, actually mhm What is it you're looking for that isn't on those pages? dunno what could be a good thing a lot of stuff looks like to be just 'a trend' are you a web designer? sort of in the end, everything superficial that doesn't deal with the content is ""a trend"". Sometimes even the content, too i write in any lang except py:P Agree with 9ad9c1c6785976c50ad1882070978e91, all design is trend-based a responsive design should be well usable too what demograph are you aiming at? Are you looking to design for mobile or for screen? i mean that it doesnt sounds to be a trend:) Doctors can't help a patient if they don't say what hurts indeed. i'll search for something, thanks for now good luck in your adventures! heh thanks i'm on a half way to end a very simple design any examples? or maybe at 3/4 of the way cannot spread the url atm it is for fbi haha, well, good luck with that just a sec http://laquarra.it/media/try.png the header isnt that well designed in order to be separate by the content that's a very small image, haha I can't really give any compliments or critique with that image :S uhmf haha I have some readability concerns retry and thanks: i dont really need help, but if you got time to gimme opinions, i can listen I would move the content (Older Entries and everything below) up. There's a little too much space under the Header yeah those bugs are to be fixed also, the big gray border is distracting. I would instead make a thin border, and just give the sticky content a different background i was thinkin about getting something like http://blogs.adobe.com/jnack/ but without a body img ;) i though that a thin border would be better too;) :) then go with your gut! mah that's the header..the container borders that looks not that attractive also, more color! The pure black background is a little boring. I would suggest perhaps a gradient of dark gray to black on the jnash site instead he added just that small detail to get a decent effect (on the borders of the container hmmm it starts to be not a fast design anymore:p i would to keep it minimalist the black body bg is not hurtin eyes mah i'll see:P haha too far from canvas,css3,html5 and such:p (it is markupped in html5 though:P) the main structure at least i dont get a lot of safari users in my area are you using html5boilerplate, or twitter bootstrap? that should handle any issues you have cross browser no hmm, look into those 2. They'll help with the issues you may have my idea is: when css are enought,use them and dont try to get some weird design haha for instance background: fixed; works on ie6 too if i start by thinkin about a simple design that could use it, i'm sure that i dont need any hacks or such.it'll be automatically cross-browser same thing as @font-face Haha, you would think that, but IE6 has surprises with how it renders certain things if it was something new that could be well supported like them, would be decent to add it never tried canvas and such yes 9ad9c1c6785976c50ad1882070978e91, just saying that i try always to get simple things ah, well it depends on what you need :) instead do things that could be viewed only on safari mhmh that's the point uff and more... why html5 got that <header><h1> usage mah Do you mean <hgroup>? i mean the possibility to use h1 more than once ina page Well, ideally headers should be used for actual organization rather than display i come from old school: always used one h1 as logo/index since html4 Ah, but old school also used tables for layout. Semantics are important, meaning use tags in the ways that are appropriate i'm not that old:p in html4 h1 was unique even someone has never respected that rule html4 only specified order, not number. more than 1 h1 has always been valid. it was ATs that asked that you not do that. convention, rather than a rule, iirc. anyway gray palettes huh Even a gray scale can look colorful and elegant, compared to stark black and white thanks for now.i'll show you something decent,i hope:p Play around a bit :) Nothing is perfect the first try well i'm just at design,so i have to start from black and white Play around in Photoshop (or whatever graphics program you use), and mix and match colors css:p Oh, do you use Firefox or Chrome? firefox when it doesnt crash If you haven't already, I would recommend using the WebDeveloper addon wd+firebug :) good and when the page looks decent, you just paste the resoult in your .css. yes, we're agreed that seems to be the faster way to design ;) chrome should be good too just i am not ;) With everything, time mhm wouldn't count on hgroup sticking around Going to make a page consisting of nothing but hgroups, just to spite various consortiums ... Is there talk about hgroup being made obsolete already? :) anyone know how to get <progress> diploid vertically in chrome/webkit? mozilla has a -moz-orient: vertical; option - anything like that for webkit? I haven't tried, but can you apply a transform to make it go vertical? If you're writing in HTML5, you can use hgroups If you're writing in HTML6, you can't bdedc97e25dde1328bae6e2d092691c8: I was referring to a08a39ab1bb985201061ef7cb138b1dd question in regard to having a vertical progress d8971eef6664fa6be92595545b27e605: I'm sorry? bdedc97e25dde1328bae6e2d092691c8: how? hgroup seems to be for grouping headers bdedc97e25dde1328bae6e2d092691c8: nm, brainfart a08a39ab1bb985201061ef7cb138b1dd: :P d8971eef6664fa6be92595545b27e605: good theory, poking around d8971eef6664fa6be92595545b27e605: awesome, thanks! np I am confused",0
"Oh look, a totally unexpected response to alexey's email about entities Evening guys I have a, HTML5-related question an* Does <nav> require a heading of some sort? I ran my site through gsnedders's excellent HTML5 outliner, and got this: http://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/process.py?url=http://adlebbeke.be/index <nav> is a sectioning element, yes <nav> is causing the 'Untitled Section' But it doesn't _require_ a heading I understand it doesn't require a heading (i.e. to validate as HTML5) But should a heading be added, or not? Considering the only heading text I can think of is something like ""Navigation"", or ""Menu"" wonders whether the outline algorithm should include provision for generic sections like navigation isn't sure if that would add semantic value 81881088ff1ac661b0eb5b71129a6849: The example in the spec uses <h1>Navigation</h1> http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/sections.html#the-nav-element Hmmm Probably, it's useful to add a heading to <nav> when using more than one <nav> element in your document When there's only one <nav> element, it's safe to assume it's the main site navigation, right? ""wonders whether the outline algorithm should include provision for generic sections like navigation"" ... oh wait, it does http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/sections.html#headings-and-sections ""User agents should provide default headings for sections that do not have explicit section headings."" ""These default headings (""Untitled document"", ""Navigation"", ""Sidebar"") are not specified by this specification, and might vary with the user's language, the page's language, the user's preferences, the user agent implementor's preferences, etc."" gsnedders|work: Is this enough to be considered a bug report? 81881088ff1ac661b0eb5b71129a6849: So the upshot is, no, you should not need a heading if you only have the one nav. 81881088ff1ac661b0eb5b71129a6849: Although that's not the same as the heading between useless - e.g. might be useful in today's user agents.

"Argh. I really wish javascript had named parameters Named parameters? like foo(bar=baz) named arguments maybe b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: should be easy enough to pass an object with all the named stuff inside b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: Yeah, that is one possibility In fact I am already using that possibility But... Or toString the function reference and extract the parameter names, then create an array with the right order and apply :D Anyway, back in the land of the sane... I have a pair of functions Well a function and a method the function looks like test(func, name, properties) the methos looks like test.step(func) I have now realised I should make it possible to change the this object that is used to call func so I can have the caller pass in a this object for Test.step that is fine: test.step(func, this_obj) but what to do for test()? The logical place to put the parameter would be second test(func, this_obj, name, properties) But the common case is to use the global scope so you would always have to pass undefined Which would be bad Putting it after name would give a weird order and mean you had to pass undefined if you want to set properties can't you check whether it is the global scope within test? Whether what is the global scope? this? Do test(func, name, properties) and test_with_this(func, this_obj, name, properties) is there a scenario where you need test rather than test_async btw with this working? edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: test() is just for covenience because it causes the test to be run immediately seems useful ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: Ugly but workable I could typecheck the second parameter of course That would be the jQuery way But... Or this_obj.apply(func, ...) (or whatever the syntax is) to use the normal language facilities for changing this b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea, it's useful, but do you need ""this"" working when test is used? s/func/test/ edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: I thought you were the one with the use case :) b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea, my use case is only for test_async edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: Seems odd to let it work in one case but not the other But maybe that is actually good to enfore *enforce testing ""this"" is always needed in a callback... never really needed it elsewhere in usual tests i mean, I can't remember having used it in some kind of sync variant OK I will take the simple solution of not solving the problem and calling it a feature also, couldn't I use test.step(function(this) { ... }) ? Yeah you could It feels nicer to optionally run the function in the expected scope though actually, how would I then access it? yeah, if you can do that and tell me how to make it work It's all fine notices he allowed extra arguments to step() get passed to the function so you solve it on your side? That seems unnecessary... so what do I do? edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: Do test.step(function(){}, this) fresh redesign of Zappos http://www.zappos.com/ by HappyCog http://happycog.com/create/zappos/ http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.zappos.com%2F&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0 using html5 doctype, but already invalid. b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea, and then the bit between {} can use this without problems? Yeah, I think so so I have test.step(function() { assert_equals(""data"", e.data); this.close() }, this) Yes Although the step is run synchronously and if the listener is inlined it is fine right? so you can just close after the test.step rather than in the test function listener? test.step(function() { obj.onmessage = function() { test.step(function() {}) } }) or some such and a test.done() after the second test.step() Yeah that should be fine I think Hard to read all on one line in irc lots of braces hard to type too all on one line b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea, I need assert_error() or some such for something that should not be reached edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: Yeah, known bug. Will work on it next",0

"man opensolaris is slow in qemu :-P lol it's also slow on a 386 :-D updating boot archive === death don't have a vmware license? trying to build solaris + xen in qemu so i can copy the image to real xen :-D dunno if it'll happen though build? from my understanding you have to rebuild the bfu archive with some modified source or maybe it's already compiled you just have to rebuild the archive or something i'm not really sure what the ""BFU"" is :-P oh... that'd make sense actually a port of osol to xen would need to be rebuilt yeah they have it online well.. the sources or something... and instructions to build it the xen swarm doesn't have prebuilt archives? nope <a href=""http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/xen/How-To-07-2006/install/"">http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/xen/How-To-07-2006/install/</a> okiedokie well, a prebuilt bfu archive, but not a whole solaris image so you need a solaris box to build a xen capable image i don't have a free box so i'm using qemu vmware would be faster :) yeah i have that too solaris actually runs pretty well in vmware i tried it with nexenta but something relating to the bfu didn't work... maybe i'll try solaris express i've never used nexenta i just like nexenta because i'm more familiar with the gnu userland do you know.. when installing solaris express if the smaller install options like the 1gb one come with gcc and stuff liek that? or do i need the whole 5gb install? no, it doesn't and you can't build solaris with gcc yet anyways iirc you need sunstudio 11 oh, ok well whatever compiler :-D gcc was supported a while ago was it ? yes wesolows put in a hell of a lot of work to make it happen *shrug* there you go then :) wesolows: thanks man speaking of gnu/solaris... does glibc work w/ solaris at all yet? i think so not sure well.. gnusolaris (nexenta) has the whole debian userland, so i'm guessing? evidently the answer is no i should build a gentoo gnu/solaris distor distro :-P oh man vmware sooo much faster than qemu see? i ran into a problem w/ opensolaris in vmware before, regarding nfs4, i think it was more a problem w/ vmware, but when i tried to rsync a whole computer to a vmware/opensolaris server it would hang opensolaris i think it is a problem w/ the vmware network drivers but i'm not sure could be heh, installing opensolaris in vmware, lets see how long this takes, took like 3 horus in qemu :-D it takes about a half hour faster if you're using an iso as the cdrom yeah, i'm using an iso, i'm trying the core install, hoping it'll have everything i need it probably won't yeha, your probably right like a ""core install"" of linux kernel, glibc, gnu coreutils and sysvinit nothing else i can get a useful installation of linux in 1gb :-P oh wow, this said it would be 900mb but it's only 300 i can get a pretty useful install in a couple megs, for certain values of ""useful"" eh ok, maybe i'll reinstall is there an option that has a more robust console.. but no gui? you could do it package by package eh too lazy for that especially with pkg-add *shudder* :-D what's wrong with sysv package tools?

"Does SPDY work with http: URLs via some triggers in a plain initial GET? or does it require a new URL scheme? I asked the Google folks about it some time ago and they said their intention was to allow some form of negotiation (so you could use http: URLs) but that wasn't implemented yet; not sure what the current state is one thing I don't understand is whether SPDY is symmetrically bidirectional and therefore whether it could address some of the use cases for the WebSocket protocol the whitepaper doesn't seem to mention anything about it either way some people in the HyBi list seemed to think it had some sort of bidirectional nature, which seemed surprising to me, but I don't understand it in enough detail to comment 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: it is bidirectional It seems to me that the chances of success would be greater if it used an existing URL scheme and upgraded somehow the server can create a stream, but I imagine that would not arise in the course of normal HTTP processing and there's no clear suggestion for how the client would reflect such a thing though they are using SSL, so to avoid a lot of overhead, it would need to bootstrap from https: yes, I think that is a potentially important deployment issue otherwise, if some clients support SPDY and others do not, sites would have to duplicate their content to use it also to cut through firewalls, you'd want to bootstrap from an existing port worse yet, they would have to duplicate all links in the outside world, which is not possible duplicating outside links seems like a fatal flaw if SPDY has the flaw I'm surprised it isn't in their FAQ it's the first question that pops to my mind it was one of the first questions that popped into my mind too interesting. the captioning at http://www.spreadfirefox.com/5years/en-US/ is can move away from the browser-native video controls but the captions don't show up when loading the video in a stand-alone browsing context wonders if moving away is a mouseover trick with hard-coded Firefox native controls size looks like a scripted overlaid HTML element",0
"So the html wg IRC channel is on yet another network. That puts my single-channel network count at... 6 it would have been better if the HTMLWG just joined in here, since most (I think) of us in here are on the HTMLWG. Or have the channel on this network, even if it was a different channel oh wow, the topic of this channel just keeps growing :-) 5b67d980ae4c3c82251106e26913ce67, will you be importing the logs from whatbot into your irc-logs server? Then we can remove one of the URIs and redirect whatbot to your site that would be better yes i actually want to kill the java process running whatbot it's just wasting bandwidth at the moment i'll have to take down that server so the previous logs will be lost unless they can find a new home they're just static files so i'm sure i'll be able to upload them somewhere it would of course be cooler if krijn can just import them all Yeah sure, I have nothing to do anyway ;) you gotta be kidding :) I was ;) thought as much :P Timezones are different though 1 hour oh yeah, SAST is UTC+02:00 holland is on UTC+01:00 i think Jup Although the page says timestamps are in GMT/BST bah Is it a problem? Else I just copy 'n paste everything :) i really wish we could just use UTC for absolutely everything even adjust our clocks to that would make things so much simpler nah i don't think anybody is going to cry about 1 hour i can zip all those logfiles and send them to you though if you want I want :) cool i'll be back at work tomorrow then i'll struggle with my server a bit and get things organised today is public holiday in ZA What are you doing here then? bah i don't take holidays ;) http:/ 5b67d980ae4c3c82251106e26913ce67oetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20061201 :] Okay, that'll work Although now the fluffy colors are gone 5b67d980ae4c3c82251106e26913ce67, nice can make link to particular comment Yes If more is needed, let me know Gotta add some filters for hiding joins/quits et cetera and whatbot is officially dead :) RIP I wonder what happens when my connection drops i know what happened when mine did: whatbot got pwned :) Just a gap in the logs I suppose? yeah exactly",0

"ey :p hi Do you know Jesus Christ as your savior? no. i think cake is do u? yes, I do why? why do I believe Jesus Christ is my savior? yes? because of the overwhelming evidence that supports his claim to be God sorry i dont belive in god why is that? the bibel is very discriminating to women. still there? sorry for the waiting well let's assume for a min that is even true...... that means there is no God? yea wow i dont think there is that is very sad yea a bit. yeah but you have no logical reason to believe that there's no logical reason to believe in god because you think the bible is discriminating to women, God cannot exist? of course there is no but i dont think that god did all the thinks the bible says, and then there's no evidence of him ok.... do you know the difference between FACT and OPINION? yes do u? by your line of logic....... George Washington didn't exist because he was discriminatory to blacks im sorry u dont get my point I get your point, I think you don't realize how stupid it is and why is that? by your line of logic....... George Washington didn't exist because he was discriminatory to blacks yea u said that. your logic says because you believe the bible is discriminatory to women therefore God doesn't exist",0
"because you're sounding a little like m e haha nah, just a little delerious wondrous hm yes. well, then. okay so ilecs under a certain size get this subsidy? for providing lead wire wrapped in paper, from 1946 with a single point of failure per county? etc J4k3: hmm. the wisp dood today told me that there are things that can make canopy less predatory, like disabling certain frequencies. yep. but he said it hops six channels by default, or something. yeah, you can get it down to using a normal amount of spectrum but... it gets it ass beat by 802.11 at those speeds err bandwidths you mean 802.11b has higher speed? at 20 mhz, I believe so so canopy's speed is dependent upon spectrum predation? :) i find it kind of incredible that hparker's whole network got blown off the map by Sprint's canopy omni which was blocks away from it but it was for a month til he moved to 5.8 GHz, as i recall yep he should fire up some ntsc-fm in their general direction :P yeah that's long over but wouldn't that indicate that they had an omni with a mega amp on it that was just about as loud as could be could be an SA is the only way to know for sure i dont think it was even sectorized. i don't think they had a clue, period. and they have since eliminated that offering. haha omnis... Russell, KS was one of their handful of nationwide testbeds apparently and they considered it to be a failure. I have an omni, it sucks, I just don't want to spend the money at the moment yeah. but I suspect I will be doing it anyways well you would if you had to. the tower in town is sectorized but your stuph doesn't suck so you don't have to. and you have no amps at all, right ? this one is sector'd at 5.8, but omni at 2.4. correct i mean no external amps anyway I own an rflinx 1w amp, but its been sitting here collecting dust for a year you have the onboard amps yeah lalala sr2, senao 400mW k blam that'll dew, donkey yep hmmm. kismet says hihi2u a loooongways off lololol with the laptop sitting in the bed of the dodger ^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^ rednecking it up peeing off the side? nah, its a dodge, I pee in the gas tank to clean the injectors with a fleabag bloodhound? COO COO COO! nah, just Nugget. the canopy admin has one of those nugget = my dog LOOKIE THERE, FLASH! WE'RE GONNA GIT US SOME WIFI BOYS! COO COO COO THEM DANG OL WISP KIDS! haha THEY GOT ANOTHER TOWER UP. WAIT'LL BOSS HEARS ABOUT THIS! haha and that just kinda mentally segues into .... ""countywide POTS outages for FIVE DAYS?
